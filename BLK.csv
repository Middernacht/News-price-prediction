BLK,2020-08-19 08:32:48,BlackRock Sees Value in Some Pandemic-Battered Assets,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Energy, aviation and lodging firms hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic could offer handsome returns for high-yield investors, according BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager.Jim Keenan, chief investment officer and global co-head of credit, said that while it will take years for many sectors to recover, there are still opportunities for discerning money managers.“You have to consider how long the recovery will take,” he said. “And how will they be able to operate in the meantime in terms of costs and capacity.”BlackRock sees opportunities in stressed and distressed companies but it’s also offsetting those investments with higher quality names, with more stable cash flow, greater visibility and less exposure to the pandemic. Among those credits are telecommunications, infrastructure and technology firms, Keenan said. BlackRock’s global co-head of credit oversees $121 billion of assets.As a general strategy, “we break it down between what we would view as quality income versus more upside total return,” he said.Healthy CreditDespite interest rates hovering around zero and central bank asset purchase programs, credit remains a good option for investors to reach their income targets, according to Keenan.“That level of low rates, significant stimulus, and earnings recovery is going to continue to drive default premiums down and therefore spread compression,” he said. “I think that’s a pretty healthy environment for credit.”Even with low yields, “there’s still excess return you can get from credit of quality companies that are seeing positive earnings vis-à-vis sitting in cash.”Safe BetsBlackRock likes some of the returns an investor can get in high-yield and crossover names in Asia, and the investment firm has shifted more capital to European high-yield and financials.“Financials have started to look attractive as there is a chance they can reduce their reserve ratios that they took for a potential risk losses,” he said.In the case of global energy, where BlackRock expects oil prices to stabilize between $40 and $50 a barrel, Keenan sees value for investors in the low cost producers and associated infrastructure companies.“Some of these assets are attractive at these valuations and you can achieve attractive total returns over the next several years,” he said.Investment GradeFor investment grade companies, BlackRock’s co-head of credit doesn’t expect to see a return of the sell-off in March and April, but he thinks it likely that some outliers will be evident in 5, 10 and 30 year curve returns.“If you segregate out a few names that had earnings deterioration, I don’t think there is liquidity risk at investment grade at this point,” he said. “The asset class will remain anchored at tighter spread levels.”After months of low activity, Keenan expects a pick up in M&A activity in the technology, software, and energy sectors as companies look to reduce their supply chain risk and integrate within their local region.From an income standpoint, “we like some of the private direct lending in the first lien in mid-market, and we’re starting to see M&A come back” he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-sees-value-pandemic-battered-083248026.html

BLK,2020-08-18 10:30:10,Bond Traders Ought to Swap Mythology for Modernity,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There’s something almost mythical about the current corporate-bond trader.While stocks and exchange-traded funds are available to buy and sell across several electronic platforms for investing newcomers and veterans alike, and U.S. Treasuries are auctioned based on a regular and predictable schedule, credit traders wake up every morning without a clear picture of what the day will bring. They rely on their Wall Street contacts and industry experience to size up the new-issue corporate-debt market and quickly determine whether they should bid on new securities and at what price. Making that calculation often requires both knowledge of broad global market sentiment and micro-level credit analysis, all in the span of hours.To adrenaline-craving traders, that probably sounds exhilarating. But it’s just as likely exhausting, particularly given 2020’s breakneck pace of new deals: U.S. investment-grade bond sales reached a yearly record this week, exceeding the previous all-time high of $1.3 trillion for all of 2017. Even though spreads on high-grade corporate debt have relentlessly narrowed this year, providing steep gains across credit funds, investors still prefer to have reasoning for their decisions and comprehensive information at their disposal instead of just chasing a rally indiscriminately.At least that seems to be the message behind a letter published Monday by the Credit Roundtable, an industry group that comprises big-name asset managers like AllianceBernstein Holding LP, Franklin Resources Inc., PGIM Fixed Income, T. Rowe Price Group Inc. and Vanguard Group Inc., along with insurance companies and California’s two main public pension funds. As Bloomberg News’s Molly Smith reported, it’s a push to make Wall Street and regulators adopt industry standards that are seen as long overdue when the biggest banks are gearing up to introduce an electronic platform for new offerings.There’s no question that the new-issue corporate-bond market appears archaic in comparison to Robinhood and other instant-trading apps. The entire process ends up taking about a day for investment-grade bonds: First an early-session announcement (Bloomberg terminal headlines declare NEW DEAL); then sometimes updated pricing relative to initial levels based on investor demand (GUIDANCE); then the actual launch that reveals or updates the size of the offering (LAUNCH); and ultimately final terms (PRICED). In the meantime, behind the scenes, traders might pass along what they hear about the size of investor bids and speculate just how much the “oversubscribed” order book will cut into yields. (Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg Opinion, provides services that facilitate bond ordering and distributes information on new debt offerings.)This year has featured severe repricing in favor of borrowers. According to Smith, yields on investment-grade bonds in 2020 have compressed more than 31 basis points on average between initial talk and final pricing, compared with less than 19 basis points in 2019 and 15 basis points in 2018. As it stands, companies have an advantage over investors because even though they might know the ideal size for their bond deal, they don’t need to disclose that figure right away. In one dramatic example during the height of the coronavirus crisis, cruise line operator Carnival Corp. dangled a huge 13% yield on its investment-grade bonds, drummed up roughly $17 billion in orders, then boosted the offering to $4 billion while trimming the coupon to 11.5%.The Credit Roundtable’s recommendations largely boil down to standardizing information and communication across new deals. The group suggests either a borrower provides “expected” credit ratings when the deal is announced or the rating companies confirm their grades within 15 minutes. Investors also want an indication of the initial deal size during the “announcement” phase, along with specific maturity dates and disclosure of any nonstandard terms. Throughout the process, they’re asking for frequent order-book updates to get a more transparent look at demand. Pricing should be wrapped up by 4:30 p.m. in New York or else risk pricing the next day.All of this sounds perfectly reasonable on its face. “It’s an effort to bring the underwriting and distribution of corporate bonds into the 21st century,” said David Knutson, vice chair of the Credit Roundtable and head of credit research for the Americas at Schroder Investment Management.So then why have these seemingly common-sense, pro-transparency adjustments remained elusive for so long? Those who follow the battles within corporate-bond market structure might recall that BlackRock Inc. and Pacific Investment Management Co., neither of whom are part of the Credit Roundtable, were on the same side recently in advocating for a pilot program that would reduce secondary-market transparency in exchange for potentially better liquidity. T. Rowe Price and Vanguard, by contrast, were among those that opposed the initiative. However, while shrouding large corporate-bond block trades in secrecy quite obviously benefits BlackRock and Pimco, it’s not as clear how keeping the current primary-market process in place gives them a disproportionate advantage.It’s possible Wall Street’s biggest banks stood in favor of the old way of doing things, but that seems to be changing. Smith’s reporting suggested the bond-buyer group wants to seize on momentum from the coming launch of DirectBooks LLC, an electronic platform for new debt offerings backed by Bank of America Corp., Barclays Plc, BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Co. Or, put another way, it has the support of the seven largest U.S. investment-grade bond underwriters, and nine of the top 11, together responsible for bringing almost $1 trillion to market this year.Maybe I’m being overly optimistic given the bond market’s history of slow progress, but it’s hard to come up with a serious case against this modernization push. That’s especially true for investment-grade debt — companies with high credit ratings are frequent borrowers and far less likely to try to sneak through unfavorable lender protections or otherwise catch investors by surprise, in contrast to high-yield bonds and leveraged loans.The only thing in jeopardy might be the image of bond traders as ultra-connected Wall Street denizens who pore over pricing updates from bank syndicates as they hit their screens. After all, it’s hard to maintain the three-decade-old reputation as Masters of the Universe when on a level playing field for information, not to mention when robots are doing an increasing share of the work. Taking obvious steps to democratize the primary market for corporate bonds is worth a dent to the mythos.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brian Chappatta is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering debt markets.

BLK,2020-08-17 18:14:40,Wall Street Firms Growing Cautious on Muni Bonds After Big Rally,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Some big Wall Street firms say municipal-bond yields have fallen so steeply that investors don’t appear to be compensated for the risks that are piling up.With Congress failing to come through with the hundreds of billions of dollars that states and cities are seeking to contend with a deepening financial crisis, and prices of even the riskiest securities rebounding sharply since March, UBS AG analysts said they don’t think the market is adequately pricing in the risk for some borrowers hit hardest by the recession. BlackRock Inc., the world’s biggest asset manager, expressed similar concerns about valuations last week, when it said it was adopting a more cautious stance toward the $3.9 trillion market.UBS analysts said in a note to clients that they “don’t believe that deteriorating credit fundamentals are fully priced in for weaker borrowers,” leading the firm to focus on higher-rated securities. But AllianceBernstein, the money manager, said that benchmark muni yields have also sunk so much that Treasuries may be a better bet ahead of the fall, when the seasonal increase in demand caused by a wave of debt payments subsides.“We’ve had a strong run, a consistent run for about three and a half months,” Kathleen McNamara, senior municipal-bond strategist at UBS’s wealth management arm, said in an interview. “The technicals are set to weaken in September following a very strong August.”The yields on municipal bonds have tumbled to the lowest since the early 1950s, with top-rated 10-year securities paying 0.6%, even as the deep economic contraction slashes government tax collections and the revenue of airports, public transportation systems, stadiums and others that have borrowed in the market.Related story: BlackRock Turns ‘Cautious’ on Muni Bonds as Yields DisappearThe price run up has been fueled in part by the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts and commitment to lend to governments if needed, a step that arrested March’s selloff by improving investors’ confidence. Cash has also been flowing into mutual funds just as bondholders receive debt payments that they typically seek to reinvest, increasing demand for new debt issues.Those factors have blunted concerns about the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, which has left states facing budget shortfalls estimated at about $555 billion through 2022. Municipal market analysts expected Congress to come through with hundreds of billions of dollars in aid for states and local governments, only to see lawmakers adjourn without reaching agreement on another economic stimulus measure. Even so, yields have been little changed.“We were waiting for Washington to agree on a stimulus package and that hasn’t happened,” McNamara said.“What’s surprising is that it’s delayed and the fact that the muni market hasn’t reacted negatively as of yet on a price basis,” she said. “At this stage, if there are a couple of catalysts it wouldn’t be a surprise the market would back up a little bit.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-firms-growing-cautious-181440865.html

BLK,2020-08-17 10:00:07,Fed Gently Nudges Muni Market and Deadlocked Congress,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The Federal Reserve’s actions speak louder than its words. Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues have sent their first shot across the bow of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other negotiators who have failed to reconcile their differences in providing aid to strapped state and local governments.On its face, the Fed’s announcement last week that it would reduce borrowing costs by 50 basis points in its Municipal Liquidity Facility didn’t make much of a splash. Partly that’s because the yield spreads remain far too wide for all but the most troubled issuers. Illinois is the only state that has taken out a loan since the program was announced in April, and New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority is the only other borrower that has shown any interest in tapping the central bank. It didn’t help that the updated term sheet was published after U.S. markets closed and less than an hour after Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden revealed Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate.Still, what the Fed has made clear during the coronavirus crisis is that it prefers to jawbone the markets it has never backstopped before, like corporate debt and municipal bonds, rather than rushing in with a heavy hand, as it does with U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. By and large, that strategy has worked seamlessly: Both investment-grade and junk-rated companies are locking in record-low borrowing costs while interest rates on tax-exempt munis are once again below benchmark Treasury yields, giving states and cities more affordable access to cash.If that’s the case, then why did the Fed bother to cut interest rates in its municipal-bond facility? It’s most likely because policy makers realized their attempts to jawbone congressional leadership into action have failed.By my count, here are the central bankers who have implored Congress for fiscal support since the Fed’s last meeting on July 29: Powell, Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic. Some, including Barkin, Evans and Kaplan, specifically cited the need to send aid to states and cities.“As you look at the economic outlook there are some negative scenarios, and the ones that are most pessimistic involve not supporting state and local governments,” Evans said on Aug. 9 on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”Republican leaders have ignored this warning. Democrats are asking for $1 trillion in state and local government aid; Senate Republicans included no such explicit funding in their initial proposal for the next stimulus bill.(1)Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin offered an additional $150 billion as a compromise, which Pelosi rejected, arguing “it’s no use sitting in a room and let them tell us that states should go bankrupt.” To that point, Congress is in recess until Sept. 8, and the fact that both parties are holding their respective presidential nominating conventions in the coming two weeks raises doubts that much progress will be made until lawmakers return.This kind of partisan squabbling is antithetical to how the Fed does things in general and certainly the opposite of how it has reacted to this sharp slowdown and spike in unemployment. If policy makers see something that could derail the economic recovery — say, frozen credit markets leading to a liquidity crunch and a wave of bankruptcy filings — they haven’t hesitated to come up with novel solutions.  That doesn’t mean the Fed is entirely immune to political calculations. If the central bank really wanted to bolster local governments itself, it never would have set such high “penalty rates” for them to borrow through the Municipal Liquidity Facility. Powell and his colleagues recognize that federal grants are a more effective form of stimulus than debt, given that states and cities have to balance their budgets and can’t simply rely on deficit financing to get them through the pandemic. They’re also sensitive to the optics of a group of unelected technocrats being seen as bailing out some states. In some ways, that’s potentially more divisive than coming close to backstopping shares of Apple Inc.The good news for the Fed is the $3.9 trillion muni market is taking Washington’s bickering in stride. In fact, the oldest gauge of tax-exempt yields, the Bond Buyer index of those on 20-year general-obligation bonds, fell in the week through Aug. 6 to 2.02%, the lowest since 1952. Meanwhile, the ratio of 10-year muni yields to benchmark Treasuries slid to a five-month low, indicating that states and localities can borrow at the cheapest rate relative to the U.S. government since the start of the pandemic. Munis have rallied so much that BlackRock Inc. said it’s cutting back on duration risk given “stretched valuations.”Even still, I’d prefer to see the Fed offer interest rates that are in the ballpark of current market levels. As it stands, President Donald Trump’s executive-action workaround to provide fiscal relief is practically an anti-stimulus plan for states, which need all the help they can get as they combat sporadic Covid-19 outbreaks. Huge borrowing isn’t ideal, but at a modest short-term rate it at least staves off further layoffs and cuts to public services.Regardless, this is not a market in need of the Fed’s help. That’s what makes the central bank’s move — and the timing of it in particular — all the more telling. The gentle squeeze in yield spreads serves as a reminder to private muni investors that the Fed’s pricing scale isn’t set in stone and that its facility will step in to absorb any significant selloff. At the same time, supporting states and cities with this kind of action serves to back up policy makers’ arguments that local governments are too crucial to America’s economic recovery to languish because of congressional infighting.(1) As Bloomberg News reported, the Republican plan did include $105 billion for schools and $16 billion in grants to states for coronavirus testing, contact tracing and surveillance. It would also give states and municipalities more flexibility on how to use unspent portions of the $150 billion provided in the virus relief bill passed in March. But no widespread aid.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brian Chappatta is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering debt markets.

BLK,2020-08-16 13:00:02,YOLO. So Give That ETF a Snappy Ticker,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- In April 2008, two funds launched within days of each other on the same exchange, charging roughly the same fees and both investing in the solar industry. Flash forward to now, one is liquidated and the other has crossed $1 billion in assets.If you knew nothing further except their tickers, TAN and KWT, could you say which thrived and which died?The Invesco Solar ETF, otherwise known as TAN, is the biggest exchange-traded fund focused on clean energy in the U.S. The VanEck Vectors Solar Energy ETF, or KWT, was killed off in 2017. To many industry observers, the tickers helped decide their fates.“There wasn’t any first to market advantage, they both came from medium-sized issuers, their holdings were pretty close and the fees were close,” said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at CFRA Research. “It had to be the ticker.”To compete in the $4.6 trillion ETF industry, issuers have long tried to stand out by using catchy tickers. As the number of funds exploded past 2,200, early examples such as MOO have been joined by the likes of YOLO, HERO and HACK as the name games ramp up. Now, with a flood of day traders entering the market, a memorable moniker could be more valuable than ever.The Robinhood FactorRetail investors “probably pay less attention or have less research capacity to go beyond names,” said Linda Zhang, chief executive officer of Purview Investments. “Some of them may not even be aware of the cost of trading in terms of the spread of the product.”Studies have determined that stock tickers can impact trading behavior. One 2018 report found that stocks with names that are actual words in the English language had both greater liquidity and lower spreads. They were also traded more by uninformed investors.There are no major studies on ETF tickers, but some anecdotal evidence suggests an appealing name can provide a boost. For instance, a low carbon fund from State Street (LOWC) and a similar product from BlackRock (CRBN) launched within a month of each other in 2014, both with a 0.2% expense ratio. Six years later, both have had a similar performance, but CRBN currently has about $447 million in assets, while LOWC is at only $60 million.Of course, the name is just one factor in an ETF’s destiny. Cost, marketing, distribution and structure are all key to success, and help explain why IYT is more than $700 million larger than HAIL. (Answers can be found at the end of this article.(3))Since 2016, the amount of clever tickers appears to have risen sharply alongside fund debuts. Entrants so far in 2020 include a gaming fund called BETZ, a commerce product named BUYZ and the pandemic-themed GERM and WFH.“If you’re trying to break through against incumbent products, then you need to be able to stand out from the crowd,” Rosenbluth said. “I don’t think it causes investors to buy an ETF, but I think it causes investors to find that ETF.”First time isn’t always the charm when it comes to an ETF’s ticker. ROKT, a fund that invests globally in space and sea exploration, began as XKFF.“I think they were trying to think ‘these are themes that are close to our sector and our sector starts with X,’ but it was just bad,” said Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.While only 16 funds changed their tickers in 2014, more than 50 did so in 2019 and 34 have so far in 2020. For instance, the Roundhill Acquirers Deep Value ETF recently became DEEP instead of DVP, and the ALPS REIT Dividend Dogs ETF is now RDOG instead of GRI.Cleverness RewardsJay Jacobs, head of research and strategy at Global X Management Company, the firm behind such tickers as DRIV, HERO and DIV, said that as many as 10 people are involved in the naming process.“There’s two things that are important about a ticker: the first is that it’s memorable and the second is that it helps convey the objective of the fund,"" said Jacobs. ""If you can accomplish both, that’s a great accomplishment and frankly very hard to do.”Cleverness is recognized at ETF.com’s annual award for best ticker. Past winners include NERD for Roundhill BITKRAFT Esports & Digital Entertainment ETF and PAWZ for ProShares Pet Care ETF.“If you have a catchy name meaning something that’s easy to remember and it’s pretty visual to describe what it is,” Purview Investments’ Zhang said, “then you’re probably halfway there.”(1) Answers to quiz (assets as of Aug. 14, 2020): 1 - MJ ($566 million in cannabis sector vs. YOLO’s $60 million). 2 - GERM ($71 million in treatments and testing vs. VIRS’s $5.4 million). 3 - CIBR ($2.1 billion in cybersecurity vs. BUG’s $35 million). 4 - SKYY ($4.7 billion in cloud computing vs. IVES’s $45 million). 5 - UFO ($28 million in space technology vs ROKT’s $9.6 million). 6 - IAU ($31 billion in gold vs. BAR’s $1.3 billion). 7 - HERO ($227 million in video games and esports vs. GAMR’s $116 million). 8 - EBIZ ($74 million in e-commerce vs. BUYZ’s $16 million). 9 - XTN ($227 million in transportation vs. MOTO's $2.4 million).For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yolo-etf-snappy-ticker-130002551.html

BLK,2020-08-14 15:30:50,Jamie Salter Builds Empire From Washed-Up Retailers,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- As bricks-and-mortar retailers face their biggest crisis yet, with a record number collapsing into bankruptcy even before the Covid-19 pandemic, one man is embracing them with both arms.Jamie Salter, the 57-year-old Canadian who founded and runs Authentic Brands Group LLC, has bought beaten-up names like Forever 21 Inc., Lucky Brand Dungarees LLC and Barneys New York Inc. On Friday, a bankruptcy judge will consider approving his bid for the storied chain Brooks Brothers Group Inc.Starting with $250 million a decade ago, Salter manages a portfolio with revenue estimated at almost $15 billion ahead of the pandemic. Over the years, the focus has expanded from managing brands to buying up retail chains. His backers, BlackRock Inc. and General Atlantic LLC alongside Leonard Green & Partners LP, recently put an additional $600 million into the business and Salter now says he generally won’t look at deals under $1 billion.But even at that size, there are a lot of them.The latest acquisition spree has placed Authentic Brands at the center of the meltdown that’s wracked American retail. And with coronavirus ravaging an already-ailing sector, Salter shows no signs of slowing down.“We feel that bricks and mortar is far better for us from a long-term standpoint,” Salter said in a telephone interview on Thursday. “If we have a store base in the U.S., it helps us build out the brand for multiple categories and more stores globally, plus having a store base also fuels your e-commerce strategy.”The man who once declined to run retailers has acquired or explored deals for some of the best-known American merchants, including J.C. Penney Co. which is still up for grabs in bankruptcy court.Retail ExpansionThe expansion into traditional retail is part of a strategy to compile a portfolio of brands that appeals to shoppers of every income level and predilection. E-commerce, at 25% of sales and growing, is a big piece, too.With backing from private-equity firm Leonard Green, Salter initially acquired niche labels like the Tapout mixed martial arts brand and solid workaday names like Prince Sports and and Tretorn shoes, along with a cache of celebrity licensing rights: Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley and Muhammad Ali.Early seeds of his more recent moves can be traced to his previous life as head of Hilco Consumer Capital LLC where he picked up some of the pieces of the last downturn -– the Great Recession -- teaming up with Gordon Brothers Group LLC to buy the brands for household names Linens ‘n’ Things Inc. and Polaroid.There, they built on a more traditional licensing and digital model. But in 2016, mall owners got into the mix. Salter teamed with Simon Property Group Inc. and the precursor to Brookfield Property Partners LP to buy the beat-up teen fashion retailer Aeropostale out of bankruptcy – the same platform the three used for Forever 21 earlier this year. For Brooks Brothers, New York City-based Authentic has teamed with Simon Properties.Landlord PartnersSuch moves promise more control amid a wave of mall-based retailer bankruptcies, but the landlords were cautious.The success of Aeropostale made them more amenable to looking at other troubled names, especially as more physical stores closed. Simon Property Chief Executive Officer David Simon told investors on a call a year ago that his company was open to investing in more retailers -- as the bankruptcy of a major tenant, Forever 21, loomed.“If you don’t change that with what’s going on in the world, you get left behind, and David Simon has been a good leader in changing the model,” Salter said.Banding with his companies’ landlords has clear benefits for Authentic. “Bringing in a mall operator as a partner is a pretty smart move for them because it helps them manage a key part of the risk associated with those acquisitions,” including rents, said Greg Portell, lead partner in consulting firm A.T. Kearney Inc.’s global consumer practice. “And by creating this portfolio effect, they’re able to manage that risk better than either a brand owner or a single retailer would be able to.”Salter expects Authentic’s revenue to rise by 50% to about $15 billion this year, pro-forma for the pending addition of Brooks Brothers, but not taking into account the impact of Covid-19. Not that Authentic hasn’t felt some pain -- Salter said the company had to make significant furloughs. It didn’t take money from the Paycheck Protection Program.Portell said Authentic’s expansion from brands to physical retail makes sense, notwithstanding a shift to more online shopping. “Owning brands that can’t reach consumers isn’t very helpful,” he said. “At some point, those wholesale channels get bottled up. What having storefronts does for Authentic Brands is give them an access point to consumers.” For the malls, Authentic can help with e-commerce, he said.Salter’s vision for the 200-year-old Brooks Brothers has elements of his previous playbooks, like potential brand collaborations.“We’re going to be very careful obviously with Brooks Brothers,” he said. “But there will be multiple collaborations. We’re going to focus on the sportswear area in a major way. Say we want to build an outerwear program that you and I are going to wear on the weekends -- maybe that’s a collaboration with Spyder.”Brand DistributionSalter said he’s been building brands his whole adult life, starting out at Wayler windsurfers and then Kemper and Ride snowboards. His four adult sons have followed him into the business and all work at Authentic, including his son, Corey, who serves as chief operating officer.“We’re not really buying retail, we’re buying distribution,” said Nick Woodhouse, Authentic’s president and chief marketing officer, whom Salter describes as his left brain to Salter’s right.Salter also exudes optimism, Woodhouse said of his fellow Canadian. “I am a glass half-full guy -- he’s the glass full.”(Corrects to read BlackRock and not Blackstone in third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jamie-salter-builds-15-billion-141408784.html

BLK,2020-08-14 13:48:21,"Young, Scrappy ETFs Still Aren’t Very Welcoming to Black Workers",,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- The popular image of exchange-traded funds is of a young, scrappy corner of the staid asset management industry. But when it comes to racial diversity, there’s little evidence that the sector is any better than its longstanding counterparts. For Stoy Hall, a senior wealth advisor at Centric Wealth in Iowa, who is African American, Black representation in the ETF world is “extremely” lacking — “How many minority-owned ETFs do you know?” he said. Only one fund — NACP, which has $7.7 million in assets — focuses on racial minority issues.The exact racial breakdown of the industry is difficult to determine. Some of the companies that issue the funds, like BlackRock Inc. and The Vanguard Group Inc., release firm-wide diversity reports. But they don’t break out data by department and wouldn’t release that information to Bloomberg News.Research firms like McKinsey & Company, Cerulli Associates, Brown Brothers Harriman and Morningstar haven’t done any studies, either. Neither has Women in ETFs, a group focused on gender diversity. (There’s no similar group for Black people.)“How many minority-owned ETFs do you know?”Ask people working in the industry, and some will say they see more Black people in their departments than elsewhere around the office. Because the funds are a relatively new power player—assets have quadrupled to $4.7 trillion since 2011—the field doesn’t have the kinds of entrenched networks that keep non-White males out of power.“Classic rich White guys go for the big bucks in hedge funds,” said Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence.Black people working in the ETF industry say it’s a microcosm of the rest of Wall Street. Established recruiting channels often exclude people of color and there are few mentors for those who do make it into the field, they say. Much like other Black people on Wall Street, Hall said there’s usually just a few people of his race at events and in meetings. “People of color always know that when we go to any of these conferences, we will most likely be the only one there,” he said. “It’s not a shock to us.”One of the most high-profile people in the ETF world is a Black man, but even he says there are barriers to entry for others like him. GTS Mischler Principal Reggie Browne is known as the “godfather” of the field after helping bring the first funds to market more than 20 years ago.“People will point to me and say there’s this guy here,” Browne said. “They can take some comfort in that. By and large, is it a world that is free and fair? I wouldn't necessarily say that.”The small numbers of Black staffers at some ETFs still may be an improvement compared with the larger finance industry, which is overwhelmingly White. As of mid-June, there was only one Black executive among the 80 people on the most elite teams at the six biggest U.S banks. Fund companies with at least 25% minority ownership control less than 4% of private equity and mutual funds. In response to nationwide Black Lives Matter protests, BlackRock chief executive officer Larry Fink this June committed to increasing his company’s Black workforce 30% by 2024.  Its iShares division is the largest ETF issuer in the U.S., which controls almost $1.8 trillion.BlackRock declined to disclose the number of employees in its iShares division, but the company employs more than 16,000 people worldwide, about 5% of them Black.The ETF industry also prides itself on launching socially responsible funds. In recent years, those that focus on environmental, social and governance issues have seen a surge in investments to almost $39 billion. But only two address women’s issues and only one is dedicated to minority empowerment.That fund—the Impact Shares NAACP Minority Empowerment ETF, or NACP—screens companies for traits like diverse boards of directors and participation in community engagement programs. The firm is structured as a non-profit organization, with about 50 of the 76 basis points charged going back to the NAACP as a donation.“Making a more diverse and inclusive workplace, not only does it make sense from a business standpoint,” said Ethan Powell, president and founder of Impact Shares Corp. “It’s the right thing to do in terms of building a strong, well-rounded and diverse middle class in the U.S.” For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/young-scrappy-etfs-still-aren-134821456.html
BLK,2020-08-13 00:42:41,Palantir Plans Direct Listing for Late September,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Palantir Technologies Inc. is planning to go public through a direct listing of its shares in late September, according to people familiar with the matter.The company, which sells data analysis software used by governments and large companies worldwide, might still change its plans, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information wasn’t public.A company spokeswoman declined to comment.A direct listing would allow the company’s current investors to sell their shares on the first day of trading rather than having to wait for a lock-up period to expire, as would be required in a traditional initial public offering. Unlike an IPO, though, the company doesn’t raise capital in a direct listing.Palantir is in the process of raising $961 million, $550 million of which it has already secured, according to a July filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a $500 million investment from Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Holdings Inc. and $50 million from Fujitsu Ltd.Those sums make listing the stock directly a more accessible path for Palantir, following in the footsteps of Spotify Technology SA and Slack Technologies Inc.Billionaire Peter Thiel founded Palantir in 2003 with a group of business partners including Alex Karp, the chief executive officer. In 2015, Palantir reached a valuation of $20 billion, though in recent years stockholders have sold blocks of shares for much less.The company told investors this year that it expects to break even in 2020 on revenue of about $1 billion.In June, Palantir added three directors including the first woman to serve on its board, former Wall Street Journal reporter Alexandra Wolfe Schiff.Dozens of law enforcement and government agencies around the world use Palantir to compile and search for data on citizens with the intent of combating crime, hunting terrorists and, in recent months, tracking the spread of Covid-19. The pandemic has boosted business as companies use its products to help determine how to reopen.Palantir is controversial for the way its tools have been used by some to enable surveillance and compromise privacy. Its use by police and immigration officials, in particular, has sparked numerous protests.The Palo Alto, California-based company had long resisted a public offering to avoid getting valued as a consultancy, and to stay out of the public eye while it reduced its dependence on engineers customizing software for each client and worked toward profitability, people familiar with the matter have said.The company said in a statement in July that it had filed with the SEC for a “public listing” of its stock, wording that has been used by other companies planning to pursue a direct listing instead of an IPO.Palantir’s funders include Founders Fund, the venture capital firm started by Thiel.

It would then sell about 20% of the vehicle to one or more local funds, giving them an indirect interest in the underlying assets, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.The company plans to do any deal at the same valuation as a transaction in June, when it sold a stake in the pipelines to international investors, valuing them at nearly $21 billion including debt, the people said. Adnoc would retain operational control of the pipeline network after the sale, according to the people.Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, has been opening up its energy industry as it tries to generate additional sources of funding. The pipeline deals will bring in cash at a time when the emirate is grappling with this year’s plunge in crude prices and the coronavirus pandemic.The June transaction saw Adnoc sell a 49% stake worth $10.1 billion in the pipelines to a group of six investors including Global Infrastructure Partners, Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, GIC Pte. The 38 pipelines involved span almost 1,000 kilometers (621 miles).Adnoc has over the last four years restructured some businesses, selling shares in a retail unit and adding new international partners. It’s also exploring the possibility of selling a stake in a $5 billion portfolio of real estate assets, in another step to raise funds and attract foreign investors.“Since embarking on our co-investment and partnership strategy, Adnoc continues to attract world-class partners and leading institutional investors,” the company said in an emailed statement Tuesday. “The recent gas pipeline infrastructure transaction offered an attractive and stable investment proposition that continues to garner significant interest from the business and investment community.”The state energy producer has brought international investors into its refining and oil-field servicing arms. KKR & Co. and BlackRock Inc. last year agreed to invest $4 billion in Adnoc’s oil pipelines and were later followed by GIC.Saudi Aramco has also asked advisers to study a sale of part of its pipeline unit, Bloomberg News reported in March.

BLK,2020-08-11 10:40:15,SoftBank Moves Into Asset Management After Return to Profits,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Masayoshi Son is launching a new asset management venture to buy stocks in publicly traded companies, expanding SoftBank Group Corp.’s investment efforts as it rebounded from record losses to profitability.The Tokyo-based company reported net income of 1.26 trillion yen ($11.8 billion) for the three months ended June 30, following a loss of 1.44 trillion yen three months earlier. The profit was boosted by more than 1 trillion yen in one-time gains from the sale of Sprint Corp. and shares in T-Mobile US Inc.Son has shifted his attention to investments in recent years after building his fortune in the telecom sector. The asset management initiative expands on previous efforts like the $100 billion Vision Fund, which he set up three years ago to take stakes in private startups. The new arm has already purchased shares in Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc.“As an investment company, we need to explore various angles and scope. But our focus is still on companies driving the information revolution,” said Son. “This is the purpose of our company.”SoftBank will own 67% of the asset management firm, while Son personally will own the rest. The unit has about $555 million in capital, he said.It’s not clear why Son thinks SoftBank will have an edge in picking stocks, moving into a field crowded with heavyweights like Fidelity Investments and BlackRock Inc. The effort may increase the volatility of SoftBank earnings, which has grown with initiatives like the Vision Fund.“Investors will need to build greater risk into their expectations -- and Masa investing alongside is not a good look,” said Kirk Boodry, an analyst at Redex Research who writes for Smartkarma. “Launching a new investment vehicle targeted at public tech when Nasdaq is near all-time highs with bubble concerns seems like a good way to keep the share price discount to public value from closing.”The Japanese billionaire has pulled off a remarkably speedy comeback after the worst loss in his company’s 39-year history. A global rally in technology shares lifted the value of SoftBank’s stakes in publicly traded firms like Uber Technologies Inc. and improved the prospects for startups in its portfolio, from China’s Didi Chuxing to South Korea’s Coupang.Far from striking a winning pose on Tuesday however, Son emphasized the importance of defense. He opened his presentation with slides depicting a 16th century battle between two Japanese lords. Oda Nobunaga, who would go on to unify Japan, won the engagement by sheltering his riflemen inside a wooden structure to protect them from samurai on horseback.“You can’t skimp on defense,” Son said. “We need to strengthen our defense. Defense is cash.”SoftBank also stopped reporting operating profit, long a key metric tracked by investors. It said the figure is “no longer meaningful” as the company becomes a “strategic investment holding company.”SoftBank is in the process of offloading 4.5 trillion yen in assets to fund share repurchases and to pay down debt. The company already raised 4.3 trillion yen through sales that include stakes in T-Mobile, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and its domestic telecom unit, completing about 95% of the program.The Vision Fund returned to profitability, following a 1.13 trillion yen loss in the previous quarter. SoftBank booked a 296.6 billion yen gain on Vision Fund investments in the quarter, including 111.4 billion yen in realized gains after selling a portion of its shares in four listed portfolio companies. About $1.4 billion of the unrealized gains came from holdings in public companies, with Uber responsible for about $700 million and Ping An Good Doctor, Vir Biotechnology Inc. and Guardant Health Inc. contributing about $200 million each.“It’s still too early to say that it will be all profits at the Vision Fund going forward,” Son said in a live-streamed briefing. “But things are turning around in a big way.”Several SoftBank-backed companies have also pulled off successful initial public offerings, raising the prospects for more in the future. Online home-insurance provider Lemonade Inc. more than doubled in the days after its initial public offering last month, while oncology drug developer Relay Therapeutics Inc. has surged about the same amount since its trading debut.Beike Zhaofang, a Chinese online property brokerage backed by SoftBank, said last week it is seeking to raise about $2 billion in a U.S. IPO. DoorDash Inc., a U.S. food delivery company backed by SoftBank, has filed paperwork for a public stock listing. Online insurance platform Policybazaar and e-commerce giant Coupang are preparing for offerings in 2021.Son confirmed that SoftBank is looking to sell or take public Arm Ltd., the chip design firm that he bought four years ago for $32 billion. He said he may accelerate plans for an Arm IPO from the original 2023 schedule or he may sell part or all of the firm. Bloomberg News reported earlier this month that Nvidia Corp. is in advanced talked to acquire Arm.Son put plans for a second Vision Fund on hold after missteps, including the meltdown at WeWork. Now, the fund’s upbeat results and a renewed investor appetite for risk could revive the idea, according to Atul Goyal, senior analyst at Jefferies Group.”Our strategy hasn’t changed,” Son said at the briefing. “We still plan on unicorn hunting with Vision Fund 2, 3 and so on.”(Updates with details from the briefing from ninth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/softbank-returns-profit-record-losses-062047809.html

That meant taking a hard line.But Argentina, mired in the ninth default in its history, is on pace for its worst contraction ever. Talks had dragged on during eight months with half a dozen deadline extensions, multiple proposals, and hours of negotiations with some of the world’s largest funds conducted over Zoom. The difference with creditors was about 3 cents on the dollar.The complexity of rebuilding the economy with no access to credit, in the middle of a pandemic and just years after resolving the last painful default that dragged on for 15 years brought more pragmatism to the current team and put into motion a frantic three days of negotiations that culminated in a $65 billion restructuring agreement.In the hours that transpired between the initial Friday decision and an announcement for a deal worth about 55 cents on the dollar early Tuesday, the country and three groups of creditors holding over half of the country’s debt met half way. This story is based on interviews with a dozen people with direct knowledge of the discussions, who requested anonymity discussing private conversations.On Sunday Aug. 2, despite an interview with Guzman on the front page of a staunch pro-government newspaper delivering an ultimatum to creditors to take the latest offer or face significant delays, the wheels were already turning to reach a deal.Guzman, a 37-year-old protege of Joseph Stiglitz, lobbed in calls to his financial advisers at Lazard Ltd to ask them to update different debt models to present to Fernandez.READ MORE: Argentina Bonds Rally After $65 Billion Restructuring DealThe main request Guzman had made to the advisers was simple, to bring forward interest and principal payments, an idea that both sides had discussed before. It was a change that may have seemed cosmetic but that meant an improvement for creditors concerned with the time value of money, even if Argentina wasn’t putting forward more cash. Guzman met Fernandez at the presidential residence on Sunday afternoon and got the green light to make the adjustments and go back to creditors. The government was also ready to accept bondholder interpretations on some legal loopholes.BlackRock RoleThe key step to unlocking a deal came from an unexpected ally: BlackRock Inc.Despite early run-ins with BlackRock executives in talks, Guzman had built a good rapport with managing director Jennifer O’Neil. Both under 40, they share similar temperaments -- cool, collected and formal, according to people involved in talks.During more than six hours of negotiations spread over several calls with her through the weekend, an agreement was reached.O’Neil then spoke to a few key creditors between Sunday and Monday while the three major creditor groups went back to get buy-in from about 30 funds. The bondholder groups, which began the process with competing proposals, had banded into a single bloc in late July amid a lack of progress.In addition to BlackRock’s leadership, the agreement involved heavy lifting from fund managers at Ayres Investment Management and Monarch Alternative Capital, as well as government advisers, particularly Sebastian Loketek of Bank of America Corp, the people said.Also involved in the big-picture thinking throughout the deal was Peter Orszag, a former Obama administration official who’s the chief executive officer of financial advisory at Lazard and a contributor to Bloomberg Opinion.BlackRock wasn’t always seen as a unifier in the process.At one point, talks stalled after confrontations with then-negotiator, portfolio manager and former top Mexico finance ministry official Gerardo Rodriguez. Certain heated exchanges, including one in which Rodriguez told Guzman he expected to outlast the minister, led the fund to appear as an adversary in local media portrayals.At a certain point, O’Neil replaced Rodriguez as the main face on Zoom calls even though he retained a role in the process.Argentina’s Economy Ministry and BlackRock declined to comment on details of the negotiations.Political SupportOn Monday, as creditors and advisers worked through paperwork and statements, smoothing out certain wording issues with funds like Ashmore Group Plc and Autonomy Capital, Guzman paid a visit to the home of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner to discuss the deal, two of the people said.While it was understood that the current vice president -- who ran the country from 2007-2015 -- had the power to “veto” the accord, she gave it her approval, said another person. On Tuesday evening, President Fernandez addressed her role in a televised interview.“At one point, when I was taking a hard line, two people told me to look at the context and soften my stance,” Fernandez said. “One of them was Cristina.” The other was ex-Economy Minister Roberto Lavagna, he said.Lavagna had been the architect of a 2005 restructuring that imposed roughly 70% losses on creditors but also led to a 15-year standoff with holdout creditors infamously led by billionaire Paul Singer of Elliott Management Corp. Fernandez de Kirchner had refused to concede to holdout demands and a U.S. court order leading to another default in 2014 that was resolved by Mauricio Macri in 2016.Another local politician actively involved throughout the process was the speaker of the Lower House, Sergio Massa. Massa stayed in touch with key fund managers this year to both explain how local political signaling worked and also to relay their views to Fernandez, keeping him in the loop on what would be considered a feasible deal.With the political blessing needed to close an agreement, Guzman returned to the ministry.The government’s advisers were keen to post the release before market open and the president asked to release a statement as soon as it was ready.After many months of tension -- often between the creditors themselves -- the mood lightened in the final video call at 2:30 a.m. on Aug. 4 shortly before the official release, with investors and officials sharing a laugh, the people said.With Argentina’s bonds trading in the low 20-cent range in March, creditors weren’t always confident of a quick deal, nor one that fetched an NPV in the mid-50’s.Now the clock is ticking to actually execute the deal, reach participation thresholds and squash the possibility of another drawn-out legal battle by Sept. 4.(Updates to add detail on Lazard’s role in 14th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inside-frenetic-days-changed-argentina-202719325.html

The deal makes Epic the fifth-most-valuable technology startup in the U.S.The Cary, North Carolina-based company said the total size of the financing was $1.78 billion. That includes investments from Baillie Gifford, funds managed by BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments and Lightspeed Venture Partners. The number also contains last month’s $250 million investment from Sony Corp. and purchases from employee equity holders.Bloomberg reported in April that Epic, which also owns a widely used set of game development tools called the Unreal Engine, was seeking investments at a value of more than $15 billion. By June, as the effects of the coronavirus pandemic boosted demand for video games, the valuation had reached about $17 billion.With the funds secured, Epic is now more valuable than the likes of DoorDash Inc. and Instacart Inc., two food delivery companies that have also benefited from pandemic-related spending. Epic only trails Stripe Inc., Space Exploration Technologies Corp., Palantir Technologies Inc. and Airbnb Inc. in the U.S., according to technology market research firm CB Insights.Read more: Fortnite’s Tim Sweeney Comes Out Swinging at Apple, GoogleFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fortnite-maker-epic-games-becomes-151152565.html

BLK,2020-08-06 13:27:03,BlackRock Joins Crescendo of Inflation Warnings Amid Virus Fight,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. has joined a growing chorus of investors and analysts warning of resurgent inflation risks, as the global battle against the coronavirus crisis creates a convergence of ultra-easy monetary policy and expansionary budgets.The world’s largest asset manager pointed Thursday to a potential pickup in U.K. price pressures after the Bank of England held record-low interest rates and maintained its asset-purchase program. Last week, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. highlighted growing concerns over the U.S. inflation outlook, which the bank said could even threaten the dollar’s reserve-currency status.While the world’s nations are unleashing unprecedented spending to counter the economic shock from the pandemic, central banks are maintaining ultra-loose monetary conditions to cap the costs of such fiscal largess. This policy combination is now fueling fears of a spike in consumer prices down the line as more money chases fewer goods.Market-implied price expectations have climbed globally in recent months, fueling a rally in gold, and Wall Street’s heavyweights from Pacific Investment Management Co. to AllianceBernstein Holding LP have cautioned in recent months that inflation is a problem that’s bound to return.“While there is little likelihood of material near-term inflation, once we look out further into this decade, the co-ordination of monetary and fiscal policy that we have seen -- a blurring of the traditional boundaries -- could bring about upside inflation risks globally,” Vivek Paul, BlackRock’s chief investment strategist for the U.K., said in emailed comments. Investors “should consider global inflation-linked bonds.”Inflation can wreck even the safest portfolio by eroding investment value for decades. But the younger generation of investors, within developed markets at least, has rarely faced it in any meaningful way -- the last major episode was back in the 1970s and ’80s. Still, the world-altering impact of the pandemic is fueling fears of a comeback.Inflation SwapsThe U.S. five-year-five year forward inflation swap rate, a key gauge of long-term price expectations, has climbed to 1.9% from a record low of 0.97% in March. Similar measures have also risen in the euro area and the U.K.A blistering rally in the price gold, a traditional hedge against inflation, also signals rising demand for protection against a potential pickup in prices. Pictet Asset Management’s chief strategist, Luca Paolini, said this week that the fund has an overweight position in bullion given risks including that of “liquidity-induced inflation.”BlackRock added that the BOE could choose to boost its quantitative easing program again by the end of the year, while traders in money markets are pricing negative interest rates in 2021. Governor Andrew Bailey said after Thursday’s decision that negative rates “are part of our toolbox, but at the moment we don’t have a plan to use them.”U.K. 10-year real yields, which strip out inflation, are hovering close to record lows at around minus 3%. The rate on similar-maturity conventional bonds is currently at around 0.11%.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-joins-crescendo-inflation-warnings-132703797.html
BLK,2020-08-06 00:34:46,BlackRock Lets Global Staff Work Remotely for Rest of Year,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager, is allowing employees around the world to work remotely for the remainder of 2020.The New York-based firm will permit its more than 16,000 employees to choose working remotely, at the office or a combination of the two as its facilities reopen following a split-operations model in most locations, according to a memo viewed by Bloomberg News.The notice, sent to employees on Aug. 3, said that because of potential tax and compliance implications, they must tell the company if they are working from a location other than their home address on file.The biggest Wall Street firms are navigating how and when to bring employees safely back to office buildings in global financial hubs, after lockdowns to address the Covid-19 pandemic forced them to do their jobs remotely for months. Wells Fargo & Co. said Wednesday it will keep about 200,000 employees working at home through at least Oct. 1.The longer-term guidance also builds on announcements made by companies outside the finance industry, including Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which said last week it will let employees work from home until July 2021.A spokesman for BlackRock declined to comment beyond the memo.(Adds Wells Fargo in fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-lets-global-staff-remotely-003446558.html

They were down 19% to $17 at 1:07 p.m. in New York trading.The company has a market value of about $3.4 billion based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Including debt, cash and other considerations, the company had an enterprise value of $7.6 billion, people familiar with the matter said before Wednesday’s trading.When it was taken private by Apollo in 2016, the company was valued at $4.3 billion including debt at the time.The San Antonio, Texas-based company estimates its net loss for the second quarter will be $24 million to $44 million on revenue of $655 million to $657 million, its listing documents show.Rackspace designs and operates its customers’ cloud platforms. It has more than 120,000 customers across 120 countries and about 6,800 employees, which the company calls “Rackers.”Chief Executive Officer Kevin Jones said in an interview that one of the biggest changes since Apollo acquired Rackspace is that it no longer competes with Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google.“Now they’re our biggest partner,” Jones said. “We look at them as our sales team and research and development team.”Jones said he was pleased with how the IPO process has gone, saying innovation in the technology industry is what’s driving valuation.Investors buying Rackspace shares include BlackRock Inc., Fidelity and Norges Bank Investment Management, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Representatives for BlackRock, Fidelity and Norges Bank declined to comment.Apollo will retain 65.1% of the voting power in Rackspace after the listing, the filings show.Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. led the offering.

BLK,2020-08-03 08:00:00,Wall Street Is Torn on Whether a Biden Win Would Bring Joy or Misery,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- As President Donald Trump’s poll numbers continue to sink, Wall Street is starting to envision Washington under Joe Biden -- a scenario that many executives say they welcome. But to some pessimists, the upbeat view underestimates the rising influence of progressive Democrats who are demanding a clampdown on banks, hedge funds and private-equity firms.Those with the rosier outlook point to Biden’s mostly pro-business inner circle, his significant campaign contributions from the financial industry and his longtime support of credit card companies located in his home state of Delaware. Plus, a Biden victory would likely be driven by U.S. voters seeking change because they believe the country is a mess. Wall Street thinks it has a strong argument to make that reining in lenders would be a fatal mistake when unemployment is sky-high and the economy remains ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic.The enthusiasm, however, is tempered by fears over how much sway Biden will give progressives and their firebrand leaders, including Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. That’s especially true when it comes to picking appointees to run the powerful agencies that police banks and securities firms, jobs that the activists are mobilizing to fill with industry critics. At a minimum, progressives want to ensure that the days are long over when Democrats appointed officials like Robert Rubin, Timothy Geithner and Lawrence Summers, who is a key Biden adviser.The stakes for Wall Street couldn’t be higher. Centrist regulators would be less likely to overturn rule rollbacks approved under Trump that have saved financial firms tens of billions of dollars. Progressive agency heads, on the other hand, could pursue what the C-suite calls the “shame and investigation agenda.” Policies like taxes on trading, curbs on executive pay and even breaking up behemoth banks would be back on the table.Serious ThreatThat’s a threat that the industry should take seriously, especially if wealth inequality and Covid-fueled job losses “force a new Democratic tone,” said Karen Shaw Petrou, a managing partner at Washington research firm Federal Financial Analytics. “While Biden as president would surely be less ornery than Warren, it’s more than premature to say he won’t be considerably more progressive than many on the Street expect.”The looming battle over key positions at agencies such as the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and Securities and Exchange Commission was described in interviews with more than a dozen people including progressives, financial executives, banking lobbyists and ex-regulators. Most requested anonymity so they could discuss specific names and strategies without endangering access to the Biden campaign.“All these jobs matter,” said Jeff Hauser, who runs the Revolving Door Project, a Washington-based group that has led campaigns to keep corporate executives out of government.The debate threatens to put Biden in a bind as he seeks to balance the competing interests of Wall Street donors and the activists he’s counting on to help generate enthusiasm among Democratic voters. Thus far, the former vice president has mainly stayed mum on potential nominees.Read More: Biden Woos Left Flank Along With Wall Street to Avoid 2016 RerunThe Biden campaign, according to people who have been in touch with it, has also been vague in private. Some attribute that to disorganization, while others say his aides want to avoid a divisive topic, especially at a time when the focus is on beating Trump in November.The Biden campaign declined to comment.Bankers’ CandidatesIn compiling its wish list of potential nominees, Wall Street is pushing for what some executives call “adults” who understand markets and have been regulators in the past, such as Fed Governor Lael Brainard, ex-Deputy Treasury Secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin, and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and TIAA Chief Executive Officer Roger Ferguson, both of whom are African American.Other favorites include several women with closer Wall Street ties: Sallie Krawcheck, the former chief financial officer of Citigroup Inc. who now runs a digital investment platform for women; Alphabet Inc. CFO Ruth Porat, who held the same job at Morgan Stanley; and Mellody Hobson, co-CEO of Ariel Investments and a board member of JPMorgan Chase & Co.A Biden fundraiser last month put together by alumni of Barack Obama’s Treasury Department also showcased a number of people thought to be vying for regulatory jobs. The top donors, who each paid $25,000, included ex-Treasury counselor Antonio Weiss, Mary Miller, who recently ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Baltimore, and Seth Carpenter, the chief economist at UBS Securities.Overall, Biden has raised more than $42.4 million from the securities and investment industry, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Progressives’ StrategyProgressives say they are working on a two-pronged plan, offering names to the Biden campaign but also developing opposition research against potential Wall Street nominees. Among their biggest targets, people familiar with their effort said, is blocking anyone from BlackRock Inc. Activists argue the world’s biggest money manager is dangerously inter-connected and holds too much sway in Washington.The progressive effort is being led by several groups such as the Revolving Door Project, Demand Progress, Americans for Financial Reform and Data for Progress. They are counting on massive email lists, social media and alliances with other liberal organizations, including the environmental movement, to help them press their case.Their candidates include Obama Commodity Futures Trading Commission chief Gary Gensler, ex-SEC Commissioner Kara Stein, Amanda Fischer, who recently served as Representative Katie Porter’s chief of staff, ex-Warren aide Bharat Ramamurti and Graham Steele, a former San Francisco Fed staff member. They also would support Democratic SEC Commissioner Allison Lee becoming chairwoman.Pro-Business AidesA point Wall Street says it has in its favor is that Biden’s closest advisers are mainly centrists and seasoned Washington hands who would resist progressives’ most extreme ideas. They include Steve Ricchetti, a former corporate lobbyist, attorney Ron Klain, general counsel at venture capital firm Revolution, and longtime Democratic strategists Bruce Reed and Mike Donilon. Another Biden supporter is Donilon’s brother, Tom, a BlackRock executive who was Obama’s national security advisor.Read More: Biden’s Wall Street Pals Think They Have His Ear Despite SnubsBut the liberal activists believe they also have allies in several staff who are working on domestic policy issues, as well as in Ted Kaufman, who is leading Biden’s transition team. After being appointed as a placeholder for Biden’s Senate seat in 2009, Kaufman called for capping the size of banks and ripped the Justice Department for failing to send Wall Street executives to prison after the 2008 financial crisis.As both sides game out their strategy, there are plenty of unknowns. Perhaps the biggest factor will be which party ends up controlling the Senate, where most senior appointees must be approved. If Republicans continue to hold a majority, it could be tough for those with long track records of bashing banks to win confirmation.Trump’s SquattersAlso adding to the uncertainty is that Biden wouldn’t immediately be able to replace all of Trump’s regulators because several don’t have to leave their jobs with a change in administration.They include Fed Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles, who has more than a year left in his term and has given no indication that he will step down. He’s led the charge in quietly relaxing post-crisis constraints, such as a June revamp of derivative rules that could free up an estimated $40 billion that Wall Street banks had been forced to set aside for protecting swaps trades.Read More: Banks Get Easier Volcker Rule and $40 Billion Break on SwapsWarren’s status, too, is up in the air. Biden has said she is under consideration for the vice president slot, and she has also been talked about for a cabinet position. But if she remains in the Senate, Warren could lead the drive for progressive regulators.Thwarting NomineesWhile progressives say they don’t expect to win all their battles under a moderate Biden administration, they do have some experience defeating nominees during the Obama years. That includes helping thwart the likely nomination of Summers, who serves as a paid contributor to Bloomberg Television, to run the Fed. That campaign led to the confirmation of Janet Yellen, the first woman to head the central bank.Read More: Biden Feels Heat From Left to Drop Larry Summers as an Adviser“The basic issue vis-a-vis Wall Street is that we want to make clear that Biden World should ask itself a question,” said Hauser, of the Revolving Door Project. “Is this person worth the hassle?”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-torn-whether-biden-080000451.html

BLK,2020-07-17 10:33:38,BlackRock’s Long-Term Funds See New Cash on Market Comeback,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. saw investors jump back in to products such as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds in the second quarter, rebounding from outflows in the first three months of the year.Net inflows to the firm’s long-term investment products totaled $62.2 billion in the second quarter, down from about $125 billion a year earlier, the world’s largest asset manager said Friday. BlackRock saw its first net outflows from those products in five years in the prior three-month period, as clients fled the chaos caused by the spread of Covid-19.The S&P; 500 index roared back in the latest quarter, rallying 20% after March declines that broke history’s longest bull market. Bond markets also seized up, making it harder to buy and sell debt as volatility spiked. Swift stimulus measures from the U.S. Federal Reserve helped restore calm for fixed income investors.BlackRock, like other asset managers, benefits when investors put money to work in funds rather than than holding cash.Adjusted earnings per share were $7.85, beating the average estimate of $6.97 by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue was $3.65 billion, topping Wall Street’s $3.5 billion estimate.“What’s driving the earnings is investors coming back to the market,” Kyle Sanders, an analyst at Edward Jones, said before the earnings announcement.Among other highlights:Assets under management rose to $7.3 trillion in the second quarter, a 7% increase from year-ago period.Flows into iShares ETFs and index products were $43.6 billion, compared with about $50 billion a year earlier. BlackRock is the world’s largest ETF issuer. Last month, in an escalating industry price war, BlackRock cut the fees on three of its U.S. equity ETFs, including its largest.Active funds brought in about $18.6 billion. That compares with net withdrawals of $8.9 billion in the first quarter, and net inflows of about $75 billion a year earlier. BlackRock changed the leadership of its active products, announcing the promotion of Rich Kushel to oversee a reorganized division called the Portfolio Management Group, including active stock and bond investing and quantitative strategies.Institutional investors contributed $5 billion in net outflows. Those customers, which include pension funds and endowments, pulled almost $31 billion from BlackRock’s funds in the first quarter. In last year’s second quarter, such investors added about $87 billion to BlackRock funds.(Updates with more details in bullet points.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-long-term-funds-see-103338628.html

Most of this growth (84%) came from inflows: iShares alone added $105 billion, evenly split between the second half of 2019 and the first half of 2020.2",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-accelerate-fixed-income-133900887.html
BLK,2020-07-15 13:30:00,BlackRock Sees Bond ETF Assets Soaring to $2 Trillion by 2024,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- The bond ETF universe could almost double in less than four years as traditional fixed-income heavyweights embrace the funds, according to BlackRock Inc.Institutional investors such as pension funds and insurance companies are increasingly warming to bond exchange-traded funds in the aftermath of March’s coronavirus-fueled market turmoil, the world’s largest asset manager said in a report Wednesday.First-time buyers of BlackRock’s iShares fixed-income ETFs collectively added roughly $10 billion of inflows during the first half of 2020, according to the firm. The shift -- at the expense of individual bonds and other fixed-income instruments -- could help swell assets in fixed-income ETFs globally to $2 trillion by 2024 from about $1.3 trillion currently, BlackRock said.The high trading-volume and price-discovery aspects provided by ETFs during the trials of March solidified their place in institutional portfolios, according to Carolyn Weinberg, iShares global head of product.“We needed a market event for some of the skeptics or institutions who theorized that they wouldn’t work to show and demonstrate that ETFs are important and critical tools,” she said by phone. “It’s more challenging and likely more costly to find the individual bonds quickly and buy them in a time of market stress.”Trading froze across bond markets in March as volatility surged, sapping liquidity in an asset class where even in normal times individual securities may not change hands for days. Fixed-income ETFs -- which trade on exchanges and behave like stocks -- acted as an exit route of sorts, with the funds selling off more quickly than their harder-to-unload holdings.Average daily dollar trading volume in BlackRock’s $57 billion iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF -- the biggest credit ETF -- was 7.5 times greater than that of its five largest bond holdings from February through April. In the $28 billion iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, it was 25 times greater.Critics have long warned that the liquidity mismatch between bond ETFs and the securities they hold could exacerbate selling pressure and destabilize markets in a meltdown. However, before the Federal Reserve announced on March 23 that it would intervene in credit markets, fixed-income ETFs provided investors with a vehicle to trade corporate bonds as underlying markets seized, according to S&P; Global Ratings.“ETFs are playing an increasing role in providing secondary market liquidity, which was on display during the recent volatility,” S&P; Global analysts wrote in a report last week. “Record ETF volumes helped to support liquidity and, importantly, provide price discovery.”Evidence is mounting that insurance companies are stepping up activity in the space. S&P; Dow Jones data show that insurers bought more than $3.4 billion worth of bond ETFs in the first three months of 2020, versus about $600 million worth of equity ETFs. The ETFs were likely easier to access amid the height of the turmoil, according to CFRA Research.“Insurers found the liquidity of fixed income ETFs appealing relative to accessing the cash bond market, as credit spreads widened amid elevated default risk and bond sellers outweighing buyers in March,” Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA’s head of ETF and mutual fund research, wrote in a report last week.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-sees-bond-etf-assets-133000307.html

BLK,2020-07-14 14:24:11,BlackRock Shows Resolve and Restraint in Public Climate Test,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- In the first major test of BlackRock Inc.’s commitment to use its vast influence and resources to fight climate change, the asset manager showed a capacity both for combativeness and restraint.The $6.5 trillion firm said in a report on Tuesday it identified 244 companies during the 2020 annual proxy season that weren’t doing enough to either prepare their businesses for a warming planet or inform their investors about the possible risks to their operations from climate change. BlackRock voted against directors at 53 of the companies, or 22%, and said it will vote against directors at the remaining 191 next year if they fail to make significant progress over the coming 12 months.BlackRock’s voting record at shareholder meetings provides the clearest indication yet on how it’s delivering on its January promise to put climate change concerns at the center of its strategy. While it isn’t a complete picture of how the New York-based firm is advancing sustainability and taking companies to task on environmental issues, the report offers some valuable insights into its willingness and capacity to challenge companies and push them to do better.BlackRock rejected the election of directors at companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp. and Volvo AB, for making “insufficient progress” on climate disclosures. It also voted against a number of more specific climate proposals, which asked companies for anything from extra reporting on corporate emissions to details of their lobbying activities, at companies including Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Total SA.“The quality of BlackRock’s voting disclosures has improved and is now amongst the best in the market, but Blackrock’s actual voting decisions continue, overall, to disappoint,” said Catherine Howarth, chief executive of responsible investment campaign group ShareAction. “Blackrock is prepared to vote in support of shareholder proposals demanding better corporate climate disclosures, but consistently fails to back proposals demanding real action from high-carbon companies to limit the risks of dangerous climate change. 2020 needed to be the year when the investment and the corporate sectors moved beyond disclosure.”Larry Fink, BlackRock’s chief executive officer, said in a letter to American corporate executives in January that climate change will upend global finance sooner than they might think and will become “a defining factor in companies’ long-term prospects.”As such, Fink said the asset manager would make sustainability integral to its business from portfolio construction to new investment products that screen fossil fuels. He also said the firm would strengthen its commitment to transparency in its investment stewardship activities, including shareholder votes.BlackRock has placed a heavy emphasis on disclosure in its dealing with companies. The firm said in January that investors need more information about how companies are managing the risks and opportunities arising from climate change, and how they are adapting their businesses for a lower carbon economy. It called on companies to publish disclosures in line with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures frameworks.While BlackRock said it understood that producing comprehensive disclosures requires a significant investment of resources and time, it also said it would be increasingly disposed to vote against management and board directors when companies aren’t making sufficient progress. And that’s exactly what it did voting against directors at companies including Russian miner Evraz Plc and U.S oil giant Exxon.BlackRock also withheld its support for a number of climate-specific resolutions. A proposal that U.S. liquefied natural gas producer Cheniere Energy Inc. report on how it plans to deal with assets that will be “stranded” in a low carbon economy was deemed by BlackRock to be too prescriptive, while it said the substance of a resolution for France’s Total to enhance its emissions reduction target had already been mostly met.The asset manager’s lack of support for some resolutions, such as a plan for Japanese bank Mizuho Financial Group Inc. to disclose climate risks and publish a plan to ensure its investments are aligned with the Paris Agreement, left fellow investors disappointed.Anders Schelde, chief investment officer at MP Pension, said backing from BlackRock, which voted through an independent fiduciary, wouldn’t have been enough to gain majority support, but it would have put a lot of pressure on other big shareholders if another resolution were put forward next year.“To my mind, it still remains to be seen if BlackRock is truly committed to their new policy of responsible investing,” Schelde said. “Voting is the ultimate test, and on this one, they definitely failed the test in my view.”Still, while BlackRock’s voting record may not be perfect, it’s vocal support for sustainability and its willingness to reprimand companies for not doing enough to disclose how they are preparing for a transition to the low carbon future is still significant, said Sasja Beslik, head of sustainable finance development at Bank J. Safra Sarasin in Zurich.“There are usually several competing investor agendas at work in any list of shareholder resolutions and so a vote for or against a proposal doesn’t necessarily always reflect a single investor’s true feelings on the broader issues,” said Beslik. “As for BlackRock, given their size, whatever positive action they take in the climate space makes a big difference for the entire industry.”(Adds more details about BlackRock’s voting record and comments from investors.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-shows-resolve-restraint-public-142411213.html

BLK,2020-07-08 18:34:10,Inflation Believers Win Big and Defy the Pandemic Market Panic,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Mark Nash snapped up inflation-protected bonds in March, when markets were shaken by fears of recession and deflation that left the securities dirt cheap. Now he and other contrarians are reaping the benefits of record gains in the bonds.Inflation-linked bonds beat nominal peers by the most in at least 22 years last quarter, despite the lack of an acceleration in consumer prices. The performance is owed mainly to investors seeking protection from price pressures that may emerge from stimulus efforts and a return to economic growth. While not all fund managers agree, Nash, head of fixed income at Merian Global Investors, thinks the market will gain further as governments and central banks prop up economies and prevent deflation.“Buying inflation protection, which was incredibly cheap then, turned out to be a brilliant idea,” said Nash, whose Strategic Absolute Return Bond Fund has beaten 95% of its peers with a year-to-date return of almost 6%.Inflation-protection trades paid off as the worst-case scenario of deflation was averted. Still, an acceleration in consumer-price increases is widely considered only a remote possibility. Inflation is not a concern in the current economic crisis, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin both said on Tuesday.The U.S. 10-year breakeven rate, a gauge of market inflation expectation derived from the yield gap between linkers and nominal bonds, has recovered from its 11-year low in March. Yet, at 1.41%, it’s still well below its five-year average and the Fed’s 2% inflation target.Prior periods of economic stimulus efforts this century were met with predictions of faster inflation that proved to be off the mark. Holders of inflation-linked bonds, whose face value is adjusted to account for the rate of inflation, likely would take losses if that’s the case this time.Not ConvincedFor investors like Elaine Stokes at Loomis Sayles & Co., the prospects for an inflationary rebound are lacking. She’s not detecting any pressure other than what the market has already gleaned from the trough in commodity prices. The labor-market damage from the pandemic is still unfolding, and the lockdown has only entrenched disinflationary trends such as increased power in the hands of consumers, less brick-and-mortar retail, and more renting versus owning.“The conviction level to be putting a lot of money in inflation-linked securities, we’re struggling with that,” the money manager said. “We’ve seen a lot of money come into the economy back in ‘08-’09 -- it didn’t turn around and give us inflation.”Praveen Korapaty, chief interest rate strategist at Goldman Sachs, suggested investors who gained from inflation-linked bonds should “take some chips off the table” over the next couple of months amid a resurgence of virus infections in the U.S.“On a tactical basis, perhaps the inflation outperformance takes a bit of a breather until we get more clarity on this,” Korapaty said in an interview. “It looks like consumers and businesses are freaking out again, seeing the surge in cases, so you might see some pullback” in the reflation trend, he said, though he expects the strategy will hold longer term.Supply Chains, ShortagesMerian’s Nash, whose fund first bought 10-year U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities and then went “long inflation across the board,” is not alone in betting that consumer prices will pick up in the future.The main argument for higher inflation is that an environment of ultra-loose monetary policy and fiscal spending, commodity shortages, disrupted supply chains and de-globalization is fertile ground for higher consumer prices.BlackRock, which has argued that a supply-chain disruption could push up prices, recently increased its allocations to inflation-linked bonds on a strategic basis while cutting back on nominal bonds. Goldman Sachs favors short-dated linkers. BNP Paribas Asset Management also sees more scope for gains in assets that thrive as consumer-price gains accelerate.This view is buttressed by hints of a faster-than-expected economic turnaround. JPMorgan Chase & Co., whose global composite PMI index has rebounded from 26.2 to 47.7 over the last two months, cut its probability for global recession to 10% from 55% three months ago. Money supply and loan growth surged in the U.S. and Europe thanks to central banks offering attractive terms and governments providing guarantees.Inflation SolutionAnd with governments borrowing at a record pace to keep their economies afloat through the pandemic, monetary authorities could face pressure to keep interest rates low. Such action could serve the dual purpose of containing the cost of servicing massive amounts of sovereign debt, while at the same time allowing inflation to erode it.“Debt rollover will become harder when rates rise,” said BlackRock strategists including Elga Bartsch, head of macro research. “It may eventually have to be dealt with through austerity, default or inflation. Inflation could be seen as the most politically palatable solution.”The flow of money into linkers is clear. Inflation-protected bond funds globally broke records with $2.5 billion of inflows in the week to June 24, according to EPFR.In exchange-traded funds, Schwab’s TIPS flagship swung from the largest ever outflow to its largest inflow this month -- most likely rebalancing of model portfolios, but still a vote of confidence in recovering price pressures. And this week iShares’s TIPS Bond ETF, the asset class’s largest, hit a record high after its longest advance on record. That said, these six straight quarters of gains have also seen a pickup in withdrawals.The coronavirus is a wild card that complicates decisions around any investments these days, and inflation bonds are no exception.A second wave of the pandemic won’t necessarily derail the recovery, according to Colin Harte, a portfolio manager at BNP Paribas Asset Management. Experience may help governments and companies manage the situation better. He is looking to add to his long commodity positions as a “sea change” in government policy responses to crises is likely to translate into inflation in the longer term.“We are in that type of world now where there is a lot of building and reconstruction in the economy after a serious shock, similar to that after the Second World War,” said Harte. “All of that will tend to prove more inflationary than we’ve known in the past 20 plus years.”(Adds record high for iShares TIPS Bond ETF in paragraph 18)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inflation-believers-win-big-defy-183410512.html

BLK,2020-07-07 20:25:31,Vanguard Trounces BlackRock for ETF Flows in Volatile Half,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Vanguard Group’s U.S. exchange-traded funds attracted inflows of about $89 billion in the first half, surging ahead of industry leader BlackRock Inc. in a volatile period.BlackRock took in an estimated $38 billion, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data, as market swings fueled by the coronavirus crisis spurred selling from the types of active traders who favor the iShares lineup. Vanguard’s dominance contrasts with the first half of 2019, when BlackRock led its main rival by about $1.9 billion.“Vanguard is more focused on these types of products which are designed to cater to long-term, buy-and-hold investors,” said Alex Bryan, director of passive strategies and research for North America at Morningstar Inc. Such customers “likely aren’t looking to make tactical adjustments based on what’s going on in the market,” he said.The flows strike a blow for Vanguard in the increasingly fierce battle to dominate a more than $4 trillion market. BlackRock became the fund industry leader with its acquisition of the iShares lineup more than a decade ago, but Bloomberg Intelligence analysts estimate it could be overtaken in size by its chief competitor within 10 years -- or faster in an extended downturn.BlackRock said market upheaval underscores the value of its lineup.“When investors needed to rapidly reposition their equity portfolios in light of economic uncertainty and record volatility, they turned to iShares,” said Ed Sweeney, a spokesman for the New York-based firm. “The same is true when they needed liquidity and transparency in fixed-income markets. IShares’ ETFs repeatedly demonstrated their versatility and resilience this year.”A “distribution bump” from the commission-free trading trend that took hold late last year also may be benefiting Vanguard, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts wrote last month. The index-investing pioneer, known for its low costs, tends to win whenever it gets on an even playing field, according to the report.BlackRock’s annual U.S. ETF flows were greater than Vanguard’s from 2014 through 2019, according to Bloomberg data. It still reigns in assets, with iShares accounting for about 38% of the U.S. ETF market, compared with 27% for Vanguard’s offerings.And it hasn’t taken the fight for customers sitting down. The firm lowered fees on three U.S. equity ETFs in June. That included reducing what it charges for its largest such product, the iShares Core S&P; 500 ETF, to 3 cents per $100 invested from 4 cents. The key differentiator for broad market-tracking products such as the Core S&P; 500 ETF can often be fees, Bryan said.There are signs that BlackRock is closing the gap. The firm’s ETFs have taken in about $2.2 billion in July, while Vanguard has attracted net inflows of $1.7 billion this month, according to Bloomberg data.Vanguard’s ETF cash flow this year is “a testament to our investors’ resolve,” said Rich Powers, head of ETF product management at the Malvern, Pennsylvania-based firm.“They’ve maintained discipline, continuing to work towards savings goals in the face of extreme market volatility,” Powers said. Demand has increased from “all types of investors, but particularly by financial advisers that prefer a low-cost, broadly diversified portfolio with intraday liquidity and tight spreads.”But Vanguard’s ETF inflows were coupled with outflows from its long-term mutual funds. Driven by withdrawals during the market swoon in March, the funds had more than $20 billion in net redemptions this year through May.Vanguard structures its ETFs as an arm of its mutual funds, a format it patented. The firm’s ETF lineup may be poised to see another bump in the near future. Vanguard plans to convert some mutual fund holdings to lower-cost ETF shares for clients of its advisory business, spokesman Freddy Martino confirmed.(Updates with inflows for July in 10th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vanguard-trounces-blackrock-etf-flows-130000124.html

The tech-heavy Nasdaq gauges dropped from a record intraday high in the afternoon as heavyweights such as Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. turned lower. European shares slipped on concern the economy will take longer to recover.Gold climbed to the highest since 2011. The dollar strengthened and Treasury yields dipped. Brazil’s currency and stocks slumped as President Jair Bolsonaro said he had tested positive for Covid-19.Stock investors took a breather after a ferocious rally that fueled the S&P; 500’s best winning streak this year. While data show the global economy may be past the worst of the slump, it’s a long road back to pre-crisis levels. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic said the renewed spread of coronavirus may threaten the pace of the recovery as businesses and consumers put plans on hold.After “a five-day rally where the market’s up quite a bit, it’s not so surprising to have a little bit of a pause,” said Jeff Mills, the chief investment officer at Bryn Mawr Trust Co. “It’s just sort of the natural movements of the market.

BLK,2020-07-07 07:25:25,All Eyes on China’s Unstoppable Stocks After $460 Billion Rally,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s equity market is firmly in the spotlight after an almost unprecedented rally that helped lift global stocks to a one-month high.The speed of the past week’s gains in China is in many ways unseen since the stock bubble that burst five years ago. Monday’s surge alone added more than $460 billion to Chinese stock values, behind just one day in July 2015 as the biggest increase in shareholder wealth since the global financial crisis.The advance continued on Tuesday, though at a slower pace. The CSI 300 Index rose 0.6% at the close to extend its five-year high, with trading volume more than three times the three-month full-day average. The offshore yuan strengthened past 7 per dollar for the first time since March.China’s state media struck a more measured tone on Tuesday, after earlier publishing commentaries that highlighted the case for buying shares. Two newspapers urged investors to be rational: the Securities Times -- one of China’s most widely circulated financial publications -- said investors should be mindful of potential risks and not use the market as way to make a fortune overnight.“The market will likely consolidate after strong rallies, especially as big caps have outperformed smaller peers by a big margin in the past week,” said Shen Zhengyang, an analyst with Northeast Securities Co. “Regulators wouldn’t want to see rapid gains in the market either. But there remain plenty of opportunities, and investors will continue to rotate into some laggards so the uptrend is still intact.”Wang Hongyuan, the co-chairman of First Seafront Fund Management Co., warned investors should be cautious. China’s equities have “the strongest fundamentals in the world” but the bubbles in some parts of the market “are unseen in five years and the risks are huge,” he said in written comments shared with Bloomberg.As China’s tight capital controls limit the investment options for the country’s savers, this year’s low interest rates and the first losses ever for some popular wealth-management products are driving retail investors to stocks. But some analysts, as well as mainland media, say the country’s economic recovery and the government’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak have helped underpin the rally.Mainland traders are counting on the momentum to continue, increasing the amount of leverage in the equity market to more than 1.2 trillion yuan ($171 billion) as of Monday, the highest since late 2015.The risk-on sentiment sent Chinese government debt plunging, with the yield on notes due in a decade rising over 3% for the first time since January on Monday. The yield on China’s 10-year government bonds was last at 3.02%.A measure of consumer staples rose 3.1% as the best performer among the CSI 300 Index’s 10 industry groups Tuesday.

BLK,2020-07-07 02:54:31,Palantir Moves Toward Stock Listing With Confidential Filing,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Palantir Technologies Inc. said it filed confidentially with U.S. regulators for a public stock listing, taking a major step toward a market debut that has been many years in the making.The secretive Silicon Valley company, which sells data analysis software used by governments and large companies worldwide, is seeking to go public by the fall, Bloomberg previously reported, though the timing could change.Palantir has been weighing a direct listing of its shares on an exchange against an initial public offering, people with knowledge of the deliberations have said.The company said in a statement Monday that it had filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a “public listing” of its stock, wording that has been used by other companies planning to pursue a direct listing. Such announcements typically specify a company is planning an IPO when that is the case. Palantir may still decide to pursue a traditional IPO to raise capital for the business.Palantir is in the process of raising $961 million, $550 million of which it has already secured, according to a filing earlier this month with the SEC. That includes a $500 million investment from Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Holdings Inc. and $50 million from Fujitsu Ltd.Those sums make listing the stock directly a more accessible path for Palantir, following in the footsteps of Spotify Technology SA and Slack Technologies Inc.A direct listing wouldn’t let Palantir raise money by issuing new shares, but it would allow it to bypass an investor roadshow and other formalities of an IPO, while letting current stockholders sell their shares at the opening bell rather than waiting until the end of a lock-up period.Billionaire Peter Thiel founded Palantir in 2003 with a group of business partners including Alex Karp, the chief executive officer. In 2015, Palantir reached a valuation of $20 billion, though in recent years stockholders have sold blocks of shares for much less. It isn’t clear what valuation the company would seek in going public.Breaking EvenThe company told investors this year that it expects to break even in 2020 on revenue of about $1 billion.In June, Palantir added three directors including the first woman to serve on its board, former Wall Street Journal reporter Alexandra Wolfe Schiff.Dozens of law enforcement and government agencies around the world use Palantir to compile and search for data on citizens with the intent of combating crime, hunting terrorists and in recent months, tracking the spread of Covid-19. The pandemic has boosted business as companies use its products to help determine how to reopen.However, Palantir is highly controversial for the way its tools have been used to compromise privacy and enable surveillance. Its use by police and immigration officials, in particular, has sparked numerous protests.Valuation ConcernThe Palo Alto, California-based company had long resisted a public offering to avoid getting valued as a consultancy, and to stay out of the public eye as it worked toward profitability, people familiar with the matter have said.Its dependence on engineers customizing software for each client and bloated cost structure also resulted in consistent annual losses. That heightened the possibility that it wouldn’t be valued as a software company despite its Silicon Valley credentials.That changed last year, with customers using a new more automated product that has put Palantir on the path toward profitability.Palantir’s funders include Founders Fund, the venture capital firm started by Thiel. Other investors include Morgan Stanley, BlackRock Inc. and Tiger Global Management.Thiel, a co-founder of Pay PayPal Holdings Inc., has helped launch or advance Silicon Valley firms including Facebook Inc., where he has been a board member since 2004. Through Founders Fund and other investments, his influence has been extended to an array of technology companies. Thiel has also served as an adviser to President Donald Trump, chastising other technology companies, in particular Alphabet Inc.’s Google, for their reluctance to work with the Defense Department.(Updates with statement details in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palantir-moves-toward-stock-listing-025431613.html

BLK,2020-07-06 07:28:37,BlackRock Favors Asia Markets Closely Tied to China’s Recovery,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- The world’s biggest asset manager is betting that some of the Asian markets that are closely tied to China’s recovery and have policy headroom will outperform peers over the next year.BlackRock Inc., which oversees $6.47 trillion in global assets, expects stocks and bonds in China, and its trading partners such as South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, will do better than global emerging markets over the next six to 12 months, according to Ben Powell, chief investment strategist for Asia Pacific at BlackRock Investment Institute, a unit of the firm.These countries have policy capability to do more if necessary and have a more direct exposure to the Chinese economy, which looks to be recovering quite well, Powell said in an interview. “Economies that are geared into that combination of policy, China’s recovery” and strong tech will do relatively better, he added.A variety of economic data out of the mainland have shown momentum of an economic rebound from coronavirus shutdowns. Profits of Chinese industrial enterprises rose in May for the first time since November while vehicle sales grew for a third straight month in June. That bodes well for China’s top trading partners in the region including Japan and Korea.While China’s central bank has started slowing down the pace of monetary easing, BlackRock said that the nation, alongside some of its trading partners, has more policy ammunition still to be deployed compared with some global counterparts. The CSI 300 Index jumped 5.7% on Monday, the most since February 2019.“China of course still has got a meaningfully positive interest rate both real and nominal, which is relatively rare globally,” Powell said. “China, if necessary, has got the ability to do more on both monetary and fiscal” measures.BlackRock said differentiation will prevail in the region’s risk assets amid varying levels of economic reopening and policy headroom. It has turned tactically neutral from overweight on Asian equities and fixed income, citing renewed tensions between the U.S. and China. It has gone underweight on emerging markets and has upgraded Japan stocks to neutral from underweight in global allocation.“We believe that Japan is well positioned from a broad policy perspective to recover relatively quickly from the virus downdraft,” Powell said. “The combination of domestic policy support, a relatively benign virus experience, and gearing into the global economic recovery can translate into Japan equities performance.”(Updates CSI 300 move in fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-favors-asia-markets-closely-044318321.html

BLK,2020-06-30 16:52:16,BlackRock’s Alternatives Chief Has a $23 Billion War Chest,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Jim Barry is in fighting spirits even as the ferocious market rebound drains his pool of cheap investable assets.The chief investment officer at BlackRock Inc.’s alternative investment unit is looking to deploy some of his $23 billion cash war chest on companies laid low by the pandemic. He’s sizing up new opportunities in distressed real estate, and private debt and equity.While the market rebound is enriching corporate valuations, the economic carnage the world over is creating all manner of cross-asset prizes, Barry said in an interview.“There is no question that dislocations have created opportunity,” said the managing director who is also head of real assets at the investing behemoth. He estimates that valuations for alternative assets fell by 5% to 15% in the first quarter.BlackRock, which deployed $9 billion in alternative investments last year, is unlikely to spend all of its private capital in 2020, Barry said. Deals have become harder as competition gets fiercer and evaluating deals, which in some cases include on-site visits, takes longer.BlackRock Taps Kushel to Oversee $3.6 Trillion in ReorganizationDemand for alternative investments has ballooned in recent years with endowments, pension funds and institutional investors willing to accept higher risks and less liquidity in return for higher yields.The market for private investing, a catch-all term that covers unlisted companies, loans, real estate and hedge funds, has seen assets swell 44% over the past five years, reaching an estimated $18 trillion by the end of 2019, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Globally, alternative asset managers have $2.4 trillion available to spend, based on data from Preqin, a London-based consultant.Barry says it’ll take time for markets to return to pre-pandemic levels. Even after lockdowns ease, social-distancing populations may stay away from shopping malls, pubs and restaurants, creating a consumer-led slowdown that could drag on through 2021.“The negative economic impact is more than just the impact of aggressive government policy -- this is about the legitimate fear related to health that will continue to affect consumer and corporate behavior in a way that has a dampening effect on the economy,” Barry said. “People may leave their houses for work, but they won’t necessarily leave their houses for leisure.”Among possible investment opportunities, BlackRock says it’s looking at providing short-term lending to high-quality companies that have either lost bank financing or need a bridge to manage cash flows.It’s also planning to buy assets from private-equity firms that need to quickly raise cash during the downturn, essentially in forced sales. “Private-equity secondaries are one of the most interesting opportunities here,” Barry wrote in a June report.There’s also a chance that BlackRock could purchase stakes directly in private-equity firms. Pension funds, institutions and wealthy individuals will probably need to sell some holdings to rebalance their positions after the market downturn.“We anticipate that quality assets will become available at attractive pricing,” according to Barry. “As the year goes on, we expect to see more limited partner-led deals.”(Updates with valuations in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-shops-assets-battered-pandemic-135824575.html

Pyle said investors will need to rethink how they construct their portfolios as a result, carefully considering which geographic locations will be engines of growth.Inflation will be another major risk stemming from de-globalization, according to Elga Bartsch, head of macro research at the BlackRock Investment Institute. “Globalization was a major factor in keeping inflation low,” Bartsch said.Among the other views:The strategists downgraded U.S. equities to neutral, citing risks of the pandemic dragging on, tension with China and a divisive election yearThey turned neutral on Asia fixed-income, also due to renewed tensions between the U.S. and ChinaRead more: BlackRock Upgrades European Stocks to OW; Cuts U.S. to NeutralFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-sees-rip-van-winkle-150635032.html

BLK,2020-06-24 00:29:57,Palantir Adds First Woman to Board Ahead of Stock Listing,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Palantir Technologies Inc., the data-mining company that has become a quiet force in government, policing and business since its founding in 2003, is adding the first woman to its board ahead of a planned public stock listing.The Silicon Valley company named a Wall Street Journal reporter, Alexandra Wolfe Schiff, as director, along with two men, according to an email sent to investors that was seen by Bloomberg. The other new directors are Spencer Rascoff, a founder of Zillow, and Alexander Moore, a partner at venture capital firm 8VC. They bring some long-overdue independent oversight to the company’s tight-knit, four-man board, chaired by billionaire co-founder, Peter Thiel.The homogeny of Palantir’s board has been an obstacle standing in the way of its plan to hold an initial public offering this year. The Palo Alto, California-based company is looking to file paperwork confidentially with U.S. regulators this month and go public as soon as the fall, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. Palantir’s home state requires public companies by law to have at least one woman on their boards, and large financial firms, including BlackRock Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., have said they won’t support companies without demographically diverse boards.A complicating factor for Palantir’s public profile is the controversial uses of its products by some public agencies. The company supplies law enforcement and U.S. immigration officials with tools that have sparked protests over alleged discrimination, invasions of privacy and abuses of power. Unlike other tech leaders that have bowed to public pressure, Karp has resisted calls to sever contracts. He has maintained that Palantir has a moral obligation to provide the U.S. military with the best technology available, while arguing that it’s not a company’s role to decide public policy.Palantir told investors earlier this year it expects to break even for the first time in 2020 and generate $1 billion in revenue, with business split evenly between government and corporate customers. For the director search, a name on the wish list for several Palantir insiders was Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state who has worked with Palantir in various capacities over the years.It’s possible Palantir expands the board again later. The other three board members, besides Thiel and the new additions, are co-founders Karp and Stephen Cohen as well as longtime Thiel acquaintance, Adam Ross of Dallas-based Goldcrest Capital. They’re all White, except for Karp, who is half-Black.(Updates with additional reporting in the last paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palantir-adds-first-woman-board-002957087.html

BLK,2020-06-23 21:17:30,"New Jersey, BlackRock Sued for Alleged Discrimination and Theft",,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Asset manager Blueprint Capital Advisors sued New Jersey’s Division of Investment and BlackRock Inc., claiming they stole confidential business information and discriminated against the Black-owned firm.Blueprint claimed it turned over hundreds of pages of confidential business information, in meetings, emails and conference calls, to the state agency and its outside consultant, Cliffwater LLC, as part of an investment pitch.In a complaint filed Tuesday in federal court in New Jersey, Blueprint said state officials assured it they would go ahead with an investment, but then announced they would do a similar deal with BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager. The division forced a scaled-back investment on Blueprint and retaliated against the firm for claiming the state had engaged in racial discrimination, according to the lawsuit.Blueprint said in the complaint that after the DOI opted to implement the initiative with BlackRock instead of Blueprint, one DOI official said New Jersey was “not a fan of investing with women- and minority-owned firms.”“The agency had an aversion to minority- and female-owned businesses,” Blueprint claimed.New Jersey, BlackRock, Cliffwater and several individuals are named as defendants in the lawsuit. Blueprint seeks unspecified money damages.A representative in the office of New Jersey’s attorney general declined to comment on behalf of the state.BlackRock Denies WrongdoingBlackRock said it has no tolerance for discriminatory or unethical conduct. The company said it participated in a competitive process for the New Jersey business and had no knowledge of prior discussions between the state and Blueprint.“A review of Blueprint’s allegations by BlackRock and an outside law firm has found nothing inconsistent with our standards nor anything suggesting any wrongdoing by BlackRock,” BlackRock’s Mark McCombe said in an emailed statement. “Nor have we found any evidence that BlackRock improperly received any materials or other information regarding Blueprint’s plans or proposal as alleged.”Cliffwater said it has investigated Blueprint’s claims and determined they “have no merit.”“Cliffwater condemns discrimination in any and every form,” the firm said in a statement. “There is no place for discrimination of any kind in our society.”Blueprint, based in Newark, New Jersey, was started by Jacob Walthour and Carrie Pickett, two Black investment professionals, in 2015. They began discussions that year with New Jersey about investing through its “FAIR” program, which it described in its complaint as “aimed at using or structuring alternative investments through managed accounts or fund-of-one structures.” The program targeted public pension funds and offered lower fees, it said.Blueprint said in the filing it repeatedly complained and raised objections with New Jersey through “several channels” that it had been “the victim of unlawful discrimination because of its status as a business founded by African-Americans and a woman.”Walthour earlier this year addressed discrimination on New Jersey’s investment council in public comments at a joint committee meeting of the state legislature, citing that the state’s pension fund had hired only three women-owned and minority-owned managers in a decade.BlackRock manages about $6.5 trillion in assets. Its senior leaders are about 3% Black, according to company disclosures. On Monday BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink announced the New York-based firm plans to increase its Black workforce and donate to organizations focused on equality, after weeks of U.S. protests calling for racial justice.The case is Blueprint Capital Advisors LLC v.

Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said the full extent of the coronavirus pandemic on the U.S. economy’s smaller companies remains unclear, even as cities begin reopening.“We still have not witnessed the full impact on small and medium businesses,” Fink said in an interview Tuesday on Bloomberg Television.The virus’s spread forced a shutdown across the country, upending sectors from energy to consumer. Last week, 13 U.S. companies sought bankruptcy protection, matching the peak of the global financial crisis, data compiled by Bloomberg show. While larger corporations have stabilized, the fate of other parts of the economy will be determined by how Covid-19 is handled in the coming months, he said.Fink’s remarks come as the world’s largest asset manager navigates a year of turmoil that includes the pandemic and a wave of protests over racial inequality that began in the U.S. He said he expects market uncertainty, which spiked in mid-March, to remain elevated for months to come.“We should expect a lot of volatility for the next year,” Fink said. “But let’s be clear, markets have done quite well with all this uncertainty.”The S&P; 500 index shed more than 30% of its value before recovering most of its losses since its low for the year on March 23.

They also said that strict lockdown measures helped to effectively limit Covid-19’s spread in Europe and now that restrictions are being lifted, mobility has rebounded swiftly, signaling a quick recovery in economic activity.The strategists maintain their overweight in European peripheral government bonds and are considering an upgrade to European equities, which they currently rate as underweight.“Europe’s policy response to the virus shock was slow to get going –- but an impressive array of fiscal and monetary measures is getting into place to bridge the economy through the shock,” they said.The world’s largest asset manager, overseeing about $6.5 trillion, is the latest in a string of strategists and investors including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp. and Eaton Vance to have become more optimistic in the past weeks on European markets.Goldman strategists led by Christian Mueller-Glissmann on Friday lifted the region’s stocks to overweight from neutral on a three-month basis, citing a pick-up in global growth, U.S. political headwinds and EU political tailwinds.The Stoxx Europe 600 Index has outperformed the S&P; 500 since mid-May, partially thanks to investor rotation into cyclical and cheaper value shares on optimism about a strong pick-up in economic growth. Market players are using their dry powder to buy the region’s stocks, boosting the allocation to European equities by 24 percentage points to a net 7% overweight, the largest increase in net weighting for any region this month, BofA’s investor survey showed.To be sure, Goldman strategists are less convinced that Europe can outperform the U.S. on a longer-term basis, while noting that differences between the regions will diminish as European growth sectors rise in significance and as the area’s policy makers and politicians show their commitment to support its economy.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-joins-growing-club-european-113934274.html

The firm will double its portion of senior leaders who are Black from its current 3% share, Fink wrote.“We need to do better,” Fink wrote. “We must use our voice and work with others to advocate for change within our industry and across society more broadly.”Corporate America is wrestling with its role in racial inequality.

BlackRock endorsed legislation against hate crimes in the U.S. state of Georgia, where another Black man, Ahmaud Arbery, was killed while jogging.Fink also said in the post that the firm would increase partnerships with minority businesses and create new investing products that focus on racial equality across its active and passive fund suites.As protests have stretched on for weeks, companies have come under pressure to go beyond statements sympathetic to the Black Lives Matter movement, and to take action.John Rogers, co-CEO of Ariel Investments, likened the national mood to 1968, when riots broke out after Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination. Rogers said that companies must “really execute” on diversity plans, in a discussion of racial and economic justice at the Bloomberg Invest Global virtual event on Monday.BlackRock will donate $5 million to organizations focused on improving racial equality, and create a $5 million fund to support Black and Latinx social entrepreneurs, Fink wrote.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fink-promises-30-black-workforce-223503485.html

BLK,2020-06-19 23:53:52,Argentina Extends Debt Deadline for a Month as Talks Sputter,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Argentina extended a deadline for bondholders to accept a debt restructuring proposal for a fifth time as creditors blamed the government for “walking away” from talks.Bondholders now have until 5 p.m. New York time on July 24 to accept Argentina’s debt proposal, according to a government statement. It said officials plan to use the extension to keep talking with investors.Successive deadline delays since the nation’s May 22 default hold little significance to the talks themselves, as investors have said they wouldn’t immediately take legal action while negotiations are under way. Yet after talks hit a roadblock this week, the creditors said they’re mulling “all available rights and remedies” available to them.Argentina’s Ad Hoc and Exchange Bondholder groups said in a joint statement Friday after the extension was announced that they’re “united in disappointment” about the decision to “terminate dialogue” with creditors at a critical juncture. The groups said the two sides had been close to agreement before talks stalled.“Argentina has created obstacles to a negotiated outcome and has attempted to provoke division -- ending what had been a productive negotiation process,” they said in the statement. “Argentina’s decision two days ago to walk away from the negotiating table is even more unfortunate given how close we are to a resolution.”Argentina and its creditors submitted revised debt proposals earlier in the week that significantly narrowed the gap between the two sides. But the government said on Wednesday that the negotiating process had shown divergences between the main bondholder groups that couldn’t be reconciled, and that it’s exploring all options to restore economic stability.The Ad Hoc group, which includes BlackRock Inc. and Ashmore Group Plc, said Wednesday that its latest proposal would have provided Argentina with ample fiscal room to handle economic challenges, including $38 billion of cash flow relief over nine years.The government and its creditors weren’t able to come to terms over the final value of the restructured bonds, and failed to agree on how accrued interest would be paid to investors, as well as how to structure a “value recovery instrument,” or sweetener, according to creditors with direct knowledge of the talks. An Economy Ministry official declined to commment.

BLK,2020-06-18 16:11:44,BlackRock Bets on Increased ESG Enthusiasm With Four New ETFs,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. is moving forward in fulfilling Larry Fink’s commitment to tackling the climate crisis with a slate of exchange-traded funds.Four ETFs that track companies using environmental, social and governance criteria started trading Thursday. Among the changes BlackRock’s chief outlined in his January letter was making sustainability integral to portfolio construction and risk management.Fink pledged to double sustainable ETF offerings, push index providers to expand their environmental, social and governance benchmarks and drop thermal coal producers from BlackRock’s approximately $1.8 trillion in active strategies. Investor interest in value-based and sustainable strategies has surged amid protests against racism and a deadly outbreak that has infected more than 8.3 million people around the world.“One thing that has emerged as a result of the virus and the lockdown is a renewed appreciation for the environment broadly speaking,” said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management.The new suite of BlackRock funds includes: the iShares ESG Aware Conservative Allocation ETF (EAOK); the iShares ESG Aware Moderate Allocation ETF (EAOM); the iShares ESG Aware Growth Allocation ETF (EAOR); and the iShares ESG Aware Aggressive Allocation ETF (EAOA). Each has a 0.18% expense ratio.BlackRock is also planning to launch four ESG funds that provide exposure to companies with higher scores in that category while also screening for controversial activities such as fossil fuels, palm oil, for-profit prisons and weapons.“This strong demand across our global wealth and institutional clients is driving more innovation in index and product development and portfolio solutions,” the firm said in a statement.After taking in a record $4 billion in April, ETFs focused on ESG have seen $52 million in outflows so far this month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Three BlackRock products -- ESGU, ESGE, ESGD -- have lured $8.5 billion out of the total $13.1 billion inflows for the category this year.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-bets-increased-esg-enthusiasm-161144624.html

Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said China remains one of the firm’s top regions for growth despite uncertainties brought on by trade tensions with the U.S. and the virus outbreak.“We are here to work with China,” Fink said via video conference at the Lujiazui Forum in Shanghai on Thursday. “We firmly believe China will be one of the biggest opportunities for BlackRock.”The world’s biggest money manager is expanding in China to tap one of the fastest-growing markets. China’s trillion dollar wealth industry opened further in April, luring investment from companies including BlackRock, Vanguard Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. While the further liberalization of the sector in China has been overshadowed by the coronavirus crisis, firms are nonetheless laying out plans for a market in which retail funds alone could reach $3.4 trillion in three years, says Deloitte LLP.As part of that expansion, BlackRock is hiring 14 people in Shanghai, looking for everything from compliance officers to investment managers, according to its website. The company has just 35 people in China, compared with 500 in each of Singapore and Hong Kong.Even with current trade tensions, China will continue to attract global investments, especially in Shanghai as more investors seek exposure to onshore assets, Fink said.“Despite the noise in the markets now, I am optimistic that the U.S.-China relationship can continue to develop for the whole world in a positive manner,” Fink said.New LicensesBlackRock, with $6.5 trillion in assets, is attempting to crack the China market in multiple ways. Led in the region by Geraldine Buckingham in Hong Kong, the company is applying for licenses to set up wholly-owned mutual fund firms in China, people familiar have said. That’s in addition to holding a 16.5% stake in a joint venture with Bank of China Ltd.The New York-based firm is also in talks to set up a joint venture with Singapore fund Temasek Holdings Pte and China Construction Bank Corp.’s wealth management subsidiary to tap the lenders’ distribution channels, according to a person familiar.Fink added that he sees increasing signs that China and the rest of the world are slowly recovering from virus-induced slowdowns.“Encouraging signs are emerging,” Fink said. “As dramatic as this has been, I do believe the global economy will stabilize and recover steadily.”(Updates with Shanghai job postings in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-ranks-041531336.html
BLK,2020-06-17 12:19:04,Lessons From the Brink: How $4 Trillion of ETFs Bounced Back,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- The pipeline for new passive products is thriving. The world’s biggest credit ETF is hitting records. Even a notorious oil fund is rising from the near-dead.As inflows soar and market dislocations vanish, America’s exchange-traded fund market is back to the boom times -- consigning to history two major disruptions of the pandemic crash.The question is whether the lessons are being forgotten as fast, from the risks of marketing commodity products to retail investors to the price-discovery dangers in fixed income.It’s been just two months since negative oil prices roiled commodity funds, and three since a historic schism opened up between bond ETFs and their underlying assets. Yet both are distant memories.As Gary Stringer, chief investment officer at Stringer Asset Management, puts it: “It’s largely business back to normal” for the $4.3 trillion industry.Less than a week ago, the Securities and Exchange Commission cleared the United States Oil Fund, ticker USO, to issue 1 billion new shares, paving the way for inflows to the world’s largest oil ETF after a nearly two-month freeze.It’s a milestone moment for the fund that may help draw a line under its near-implosion, even as many of the questions raised by the episode remain unanswered.The extraordinary steps taken by the ETF to protect itself from sub-zero crude prices in April shone a light on the risks posed by all funds investing in futures contracts, rather than in the assets underpinning those agreements. They also highlighted the danger of a huge fund like USO, with $5 billion in assets, operating in a relatively small market.Read more: ETFs and the Danger of an Illiquidity Doom LoopWhile the fund recorded outflows in its first trading days since the freeze ended, it has hardly been a torrent. Some $100 million has left the ETF, whose shares are up about 60% since their April low thanks to a recovery in crude.“People’s memories are very short,” said David Pursell, the CEO of Core Alternative. “Greed is a driving force for all of this. If they see something moving quickly, they are apt to jump in.”At a time when the surge of new retail investors is the talk of Wall Street, the worry is that history could repeat.Right before the fund crashed, mom-and-pop investors had piled into USO to try to surf any oil price recovery. Both the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are said to have opened probes into whether the risks of the fund were properly disclosed.For many pros, the lesson of USO is simply buyer beware. Some argue it shows certain assets shouldn’t be in an ETF wrapper, while others tout the proposed re-naming of fund types being pursued by a group including BlackRock Inc., which they argue would help investors realize the varying risks.“Not all exchange-traded funds are created equal,” said Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar Inc. “Other non-ETF exchange-traded products or commodity-based ETFs proved to be challenged in a number of regards, and I think it’s time to take a long, hard look at the ways in which risks associated with them can be better highlighted.”The drama wasn’t limited to oil funds, however. The USO crisis came on the heels of a pronounced bout of turmoil in the bond market, when a rush to liquidate spurred the widest gap between fixed-income ETFs and their underlying assets in a decade.As debt markets convulsed, the shares of the funds -- which were more liquid -- slumped, leaving them at deep discounts to the value of the bonds they invested in.It was a moment many naysayers had been waiting for. Their argument had long been that the liquidity mismatch between ETFs and bonds would exacerbate a selloff and destabilize the wider market.Some niche hedge funds positioned for precisely this type of dislocation, and their bets paid off as the funds tumbled. In their eyes, the plunge in ETF share prices was evidence that fixed-income funds give merely an illusion of liquidity.It’s a view not shared by the bulk of industry practitioners. The way they see it, when the bond market froze the ETFs didn’t, meaning the funds actually became the best available vehicle of price discovery.“You saw this huge fall-off in market liquidity, while the ETF market for fixed-income has picked up some of the slack,” said Dan Suzuki, the deputy chief investment officer at Richard Bernstein Advisors.This takeaway -- that bond ETFs are now a vital liquidity tool rather than a threat -- alongside the Fed’s actions have made the funds more appealing than ever.Fixed-income ETFs took in a record almost $30 billion in May, Bloomberg data show. The largest credit fund, BlackRock’s iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, hit an all-time high on Monday after the Fed confirmed its plans to buy more bonds.Read more: Fixed-Income ETFs Survived Their First Crisis—Helped by the FedAll of this has fed into the pipeline for new products. In the second quarter through Monday, 55 new U.S.-listed ETFs were introduced, compared with 45 in the first three months of the year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Debuts all-but stalled in March amid the worst of the coronavirus-driven selloff.“That the ETF market functioned very well in a period of extreme stress if anything will only further accelerate adoption,” Johnson said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lessons-brink-4-trillion-etfs-121904791.html

BLK,2020-06-16 22:21:05,Royalty Pharma Soars 59% After Year’s Biggest U.S. IPO,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Royalty Pharma Plc, a buyer of biopharmaceutical royalties, rose 59% in its trading debut after its upsized initial public offering raised $2.18 billion with shares priced at the top the range.Shares of Royalty Pharma opened trading Tuesday in New York at $44 after the company and existing shareholders sold 77.68 million shares Monday for $28 each, after marketing 70 million of them for $25 to $28. The shares jumped as much as 65% in their debut and closed at $44.50.Royalty Pharma’s IPO, the largest on a U.S. exchange this year, further establishes the dominance of biomedical listings, even as companies such as ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. and Vroom Inc. are fueling a broader rebound.Alternative types of new listings, especially special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, have helped buoy equity markets during the coronavirus pandemic. If Royalty Pharma’s underwriters exercise their option to sell so-called greenshoe shares, its IPO would top even the largest of those share sales, a $2.25 billion offering by the closed-end fund BlackRock Health Sciences Trust II.New York-based company, founded in 1996 by former Lazard Ltd. investment banker Pablo Legorreta, deployed $18 billion through the end of last year to acquire royalties from academic institutions, research hospitals and nonprofits, its filings show. Its portfolio includes treatments for rare diseases, oncology, neurology, HIV, cardiology and diabetes.Biotech ‘Bond’“They are looking at the entire universe of proven data which allows them to make well informed decisions around which drugs will be the most commercially successful, regardless of market cycle dynamics,” Jeremy Abelson, founder and portfolio manager at Irving Investors, said in an interview. “It’s like turning a biotech company into a bond.”In addition to Legorreta, who is the company’s chief executive officer, Royalty Pharma’s senior leadership consists of former investment bankers and research analysts.Chris Hite, who headed Citigroup Inc.’s global health-care group for 12 years, joined Royalty Pharma in February as vice chairman. Terrance Coyne, its chief financial officer, was a biotechnology analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Its head of research and investment, Jim Reddoch, previously worked at FBR Capital Markets and Bank of America Corp. Its 11-member executive and directors board is comprised of 10 men and one woman.Royalty Pharma has become a key part of the industry, especially with the coronavirus pandemic raising awareness of biotechnology innovation, said Bill Ford, the CEO of the growth equity firm General Atlantic and a member of Royalty Pharma’s board. Ford and General Atlantic affiliates own 11.9% of Royalty Pharma’s Class B shares, which gives them 4.9% of the voting power after the IPO, according to the company’s filings.“There’s very deep scientific expertise and they combine that with capital solutions for the industry,” Ford said. “They have become a critical part of the whole biotech ecosystem.”JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup and UBS Group AG led the offering.

BLK,2020-06-16 09:00:29,Guess Who Outperforms World in Coronavirus Mayhem,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Obscured by the myriad stories of coronavirus global devastation are three headlines from the continent with no shortage of epidemics, man-made and natural disasters. That would be Africa. Of its 54 countries, six are among the top 10 fastest-growing economies in the world this year. The continent is the favorite bazaar for appreciating equity after Eastern Europe and has one of the stock market's best-performing industries: communications. Africa finds itself with fewer Covid-19 cases than other heavily populated regions. Even after testing almost tripled to 1.2 million, the director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, said the continent's percentage is relatively small. Africa has the largest percentage of youth in the world, a higher average temperature and relatively more people outdoors most of the time, according to an April 28 report in the Financial Times.Although South Africa remains an outlier, with surging daily Covid-19 infections similar to the U.S rate, Ethiopia, Kenya and Nigeria reflect the continent's low percentage of cases relative to its population, according to Bloomberg News and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Even as the U.S. daily infection rate based on population declines, the measure is still 24 to 46 times higher than in Ethiopia, Kenya and Nigeria.   The trend has its roots at the beginning of the 21st century, when another pandemic threatened much of the world. Ever since the 2002-2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), when the continent's sole infection was in Cape Town, Africa has leapfrogged the developed world in gross domestic product with a steadily growing share of global GDP, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Most recently, some 38 economists who contribute to Bloomberg cut their 2020 forecasts for the world, from a 3% growth rate to a decline of 3.7%, while simultaneously predicting a much less precipitous slide for Africa: from 3% growth to a decline of 2.5%. If these forecasts prove accurate, Africa would be among the half-dozen best-performing 18 major regions in 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.   Africa dominates the list with countries forecast to grow the most in 2020. Rwanda is projected at 3.2%, Ethiopia and Ivory Coast at 3%, Uganda at 2.8% and Ghana at 1.9%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That helps explain why stocks from North America, Western Europe and Asia Pacific contributed 3, 2 and 1 percentage points, respectively, to the world benchmark's 8% loss, and Africa contributed just 0.24 percentage point to the deficit. It remains the best performing region, similar to Eastern Europe (0.2 percentage point), according to data compiled by Bloomberg.While the world equity benchmark declined 4% in 2020, Africa lost just 1%. Communications companies in sub-Saharan Africa so far this year lead all industries in Africa with a total return (income plus appreciation) of 22% — more than twice the 9% earned by global health-care companies, the No. 1 performing industry in the world. Africa's appreciation in the stock market coincides with a similar rally by the continent in the emerging market for sovereign debt. After lagging much of the past two years, Africa's sovereign debt gained 24% since the beginning of April, or more than double the entire market's 10%, according to the Bloomberg Barclays Indexes.None of these achievements apparently were anticipated by some of the biggest investors, who retreated from emerging markets earlier this year when the coronavirus became a global pandemic. BlackRock, the largest money manager with $7.4 trillion of assets, allowed its Africa investments to decline 24% to $8.3 billion. Its Asia Pacific investment declined 20% to $115 billion, and its Eastern Europe valuation fell 31% to $9 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.All of which shows that Africa is the biggest economic and financial surprise in these perilous times. \-- With assistance from Shin Pei, Richard Dunsford-White and Amine Haddaoui.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Matthew Winkler, Editor-in-Chief Emeritus of Bloomberg News, writes about markets.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinionSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/guess-outperforms-world-coronavirus-mayhem-090029597.html
