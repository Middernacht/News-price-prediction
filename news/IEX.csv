IDEX, un exchange descentralizado, se sometió recientemente a una auditoría de seguridad por parte de Quntstamp antes del lanzamiento de su red principal 2.0. El CEO del exchange, Alex Wearn, enfatizó la importancia de las auditorías de seguridad hablando con Cointelegraph:Depositar fondos en contratos que los propios autores afirman que no han sido auditados y que se lanzaron al mercado en cuestión de semanas es claramente un juego peligroso. Ha habido bastantes ataques e instancias de fondos perdidos como evidencia de estos riesgos potenciales. Otro trabajo interno en Shapeshift le costó a la compañía casi 1 millón de dólaresWearn aludía al hecho de que muchos proyectos populares de DeFi se han lanzado sin auditar, una decisión que ha llevado a resultados catastróficos en más de una oportunidad.

El CEO de Quantstamp, Richard Ma, le dijo a Cointelegraph:IDEX 2.0 tiene documentación y calidad de código muy altas.Otro club de fútbol turco está capitalizando la locura de blockchainWearn, al discutir las actitudes predominantes con respecto a las auditorías de seguridad en el espacio DeFi, observó que toda la industria cripto es susceptible a vulnerabilidades:Con respecto a DeFi, creo que el espacio en su conjunto tiene cierto riesgo (posiblemente todas las criptomonedas, incluso Bitcoin, son riesgosas). Incluso los proyectos bien establecidos son relativamente nuevos y es imposible estar seguro de que no hay errores. El tiempo en el mercado y el código fuente abierto es la mejor manera de ayudar a minimizar estos riesgos.Los líderes de un exchange de criptomonedas falso ahora están tras las rejasA pesar de los problemas a los que se enfrentan muchos proyectos de DeFi, los nuevos servicios continúan lanzándose sin que se vislumbre el fin del impulso del espacio.Sigue leyendo:Otro trabajo interno en Shapeshift le costó a la compañía casi 1 millón de dólaresOtro club de fútbol turco está capitalizando la locura de blockchainLos líderes de un exchange de criptomonedas falso ahora están tras las rejasRealizarán una mesa redonda sobre DeFi para ahorristasUn hacker está solicitando criptomonedas por una base de datos del MGM ResortBitcoin nunca será verdaderamente privado, dice Andreas Antonopoulos¿Comerciar en un DEX móvil es más arriesgado?
